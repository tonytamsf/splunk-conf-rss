      <comments>ControlWatch: Cybersecurity Monitoring for Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control System (ICS) Environments</comments>
      <description>Today’s industrial, manufacturing, and building management systems rely on an array of on-demand, uninterruptable technologies, like Industrial Control Systems (ICS), for their day-to-day operations. Escalations in cyber-related attacks have made increased visibility into these often overlooked systems paramount. Over the past year, Booz Allen has built an OT cybersecurity monitoring solution called ControlWatch that provides enhanced visibility and anomaly detection with a focus on OT environments. By aggregating data from within and around the process, the solution provides a critical view for plant managers, C-level decision-makers, or the boots on the ground. We’ll highlight the context into, detection of, and alerting on a myriad of malicious and misaligned activities. We have implemented unique OT-centric use cases and will walk-through a day-in-the-life scenario to show you how the solution increases cybersecurity awareness and resilience in a production organization at all levels.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Deep Dive: How to use Splunk to protect the environment</comments>
      <description>Can Splunk help eliminate environmental risks and save the company money at the same time? The Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) sets standards defining the amount of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that can be safely released. Honda Manufacturing of Alabama (HMA) must adhere to those standards and track our compliance within the parameters set forth by the ADEM. Failure to comply with these standards will result in potentially damaging the environment and large fines. HMA uses a Regenerative Thermal Oven (RTO) to burn off pollutants from our paint department, which is controlled by an Allen Bradley Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Using this PLC and the sensors built into the RTO, we collect individual chamber temperatures, fan speeds, exhaust temperatures, motor winding temperatures, motor vibrations, and fan vibrations. Using these readings and the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit we try to predict if the temperature will be within the set range. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Improving cost-efficiency of inland cargo shipping within the Port of Hamburg – powered by Splunk IoT capabilities</comments>
      <description>The Port of Hamburg is the main entrance to the German market and the third largest European port by transit volume, passing nearly 9 million containers each year. Although it has witnessed several stages of automation, there is still vast, untapped potential to preserve resources, both economic and ecological. By introducing IoT with Splunk, we move away from the docks and onto the vessels, equipping one tugboat and one inland cargo ship with IoT technology to measure movement and gather data about energy consumption from their 1950s diesel engines. The goal of this PoC environment is to automate the communication between ship and port authority, as well as visualize their field of operation to evenly distribute load and optimize the travel distances. On a broader spectrum, we also built a simulation model within our dashboard to investigate the benefits of adapting the vessels with engines powered to natural gas or electricity based on their consumption patterns.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Improving the asset reliability for manufacturing the world’s most advanced fighter jet, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II with Splunk for Industrial IoT</comments>
      <description>Join us to learn how Lockheed Martin utilizes Splunk for IoT to bridge the gap between Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M), and how they took a multi-vendor, best-of-breed approach to solving their most critical O&amp;M challenges. If you attend this session you will see how real-time monitoring, and condition-based and predictive maintenance for critical assets can reduce unplanned downtime, improve maintenance activities, and increase operational efficiencies. We will also show how the Splunk implementation includes data convergence from disparate pieces of equipment and existing enterprise software solutions to create new insights and allow for actions that were once considered very difficult or too costly to realize.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Industrial Cyber Security In A Converging IT/OT World</comments>
      <description>The digital convergence of IT and OT infrastructures promises huge efficiencies, cost savings and opportunities; but it is not without risk. OT was primarily built to run all types of manufacturing &amp; critical infrastructure processes while IT was built to store, transmit and manipulate data in order to conduct business. The two worlds could not be more different in purpose or design; and this can expose even the most secure organizations to new types of cyber threats. In this session we will discuss the current challenges we face in the drive to convergence and how to secure your industrial or critical infrastructure organization from the clear and present threat.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>AV and conference technology may seem trivial to the traditional IT OPS engineer, but it is one of the most visible and expensive parts of an enterprise. Everyone from the CEO to even the new hires on their first day use the technology. At PSE we were able to leverage Splunk to help us build, maintain, and manage our enterprise AV program (and save a lot of money in the process). In this session you will learn how we used Splunk to make data-driven decisions that influence and shape a multi-million dollar AV program.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Real-time public transport information systems monitoring and analysis in the city of Amsterdam </comments>
      <description>With around a million people interacting with the public transport in and around the city of Amsterdam daily, supplying accurate travel information is critical for an efficient and well-informed public transportation experience. With four different transport types (boat, bus, tram, and metro) and a host of custom systems creating around 4.5 million update events per day, analyzing this travel information depends on everything working seamlessly together. To provide accurate and trustworthy real-time passenger information services, monitoring of not only information availability but quality is needed. This use case shows how Splunk was implemented to monitor the data streams at all points in the information chain, and how real-time insights and alerting allows for proactive problem resolution and provides high-quality real-time information services for the end-user.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Solar Analytics: Changing the World One Solar Panel At A Time</comments>
      <description>Solar generation and energy storage is dramatically dropping in cost and is being deployed on a massive scale across the globe. However, system monitoring and diagnostics, cost reporting, and usage can be difficult. With Splunk Essentials for ICS (Industrial Control Systems) and Splunk IAI (Industrial Asset Intelligence), a smart energy solution easily can be created. Does it seem too hard to onboard data? See how we use the Splunk add-on builder to create technology add-ons for solar panels and batteries. Want better visibility? Using Splunk IAI, we can gain faster insights into the performance of solar panels, inverters, and battery systems. Want to understand the economics? By applying business analytics, we can easily report of revenue, costs, and total return on investment. This solution can be applied to both small and large solar and energy storage installations, and we have a real world use case with some exciting energy data!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk for Good, Seattle University, and University of Connecticut partner to Power Aquaponics Facilities Around the Globe</comments>
      <description>Wouldn’t you love to be able to give students at your university some hands-on experience with Splunk so they have a tangible skill to add to their resume when they’re looking for jobs? What if we told you that two universities on opposite sides of the United States have partnered with Splunk4Good and Splunk Mobile and done just that. The University of Connecticut and Seattle University are working together on sustainability efforts at aquaponics facilities around the globe and collecting data from them. During this talk you will learn some useful tools, tips, and tricks for how they got there, and how you can get your university enabled with Splunk4Good. Finally, we’ll talk about what you can do to teach students about Splunk and sustainability, and why that’s so important in 2019.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk like your life depends on it</comments>
      <description>Many of the talks at .conf will be around how to solve business problems, how to configure clusters, and how to improve your KPIs. This talk focuses instead on how to monitor and detect problems in the physical realm: IoT. What do you do when an agency&#x27;s or business&#x27;s security posture is a matter of life and death? What are they doing to equip themselves against cyberattacks? This talk will discuss previous security breaches and industrial IoT device failures that result in death, and how they could have been detected or prevented with Splunk. It also will give you actionable takeaway&#x27;s for you to implement. After all, security isn&#x27;t always saving dollars; sometimes it is actually about saving lives.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Teaching Splunk to Hear: Audio Spectrum Analysis in Splunk for Event Classification and Anomaly Detection</comments>
      <description>If we hear a nearby gunshot, we instinctively react. A mechanic often knows their machine&#x27;s sound so well that they can diagnose issues by sound alone. While machines can be given analytical capabilities with machine learning (ML), sensing human inputs - like auditory or other sensory data - in a form that machines can understand is challenging. In Splunk, we have been all about making machine data accessible to humans, but what if we flip that and make human data accessible to machines? I take audio captured from live and recorded sources and using Fast Fourier transform feed it into Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) for classification and anomaly detection. Can we use Splunk to detect gunshots? Can we learn a machine’s normal sounds to detect pending failures? This presentation uses Splunk to apply superhuman ML detection and learning capabilities to human data to show that the MLTK contains accessible tools you can apply to your IT and security problems. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The most epic road trip to .Conf: IOT in an RV, OMG</comments>
      <description>Splunk .conf is our favorite event every year and we wanted to extend the excitement while getting even more Splunky. So we grabbed an RV, set up some sensors, built an edge computing environment, and packed up the Big Data Beard recording equipment for a road-trip across the country for the week leading up to .conf, traveling from New York City to Las Vegas. We stopped along the way to hear awesome stories from fellow Splunk users, sharing them online via live chats and podcasts. With the power of Splunk, we captured data, discovered trends, predicted failures, and discovered more exciting ways to use Splunk to drive value from machine-generated data across the country. Hear the full story of how three engineers had the most interesting trip to .conf2019 of all!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Threat Hunting in Industrial (ICS\OT) Environments</comments>
      <description>Industrial operations comprise a diverse blend of technology that run critical processes. The proliferation of automation and networking has increased the sophistication of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), also known as Operational Technology (OT) environments.Threats targeting OT are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. Dragos tracks 9 OT-targeting activity groups, the most significant of which, XENOTIME, was responsible for the TRISIS malware that targeted safety systems (SIS) resulting in multiple plant shutdowns and the potential to cause harm to human operators.Traditional IT threat hunting is not well-suited to OT environments. This session will outline the differences between IT and OT assessments, highlight the most significant threats facing OT, and review best practices for OT-specific threat hunting engagements, including techniques that empower defenders to detect and respond more efficiently to existing and future threats, therefore reducing adversary dwell time.&lt;p/&gt;
