      <description>In Irdeto’s 24/7 Service Operations Center, our goal is to enable proactive enable proactive event management based on performance. We manage a vast infrastructure and operations stack and it’s important we have the right tools to make better decisions. We fought the war on “white noise”. Playbooks were established and actionable alerts created. On-Call schedules gave us access to domain expertise. Reporting capabilities helped drive continuous improvement. To better understand how we did this you’ll see an in-depth demo on Integration, the Rules Engine and gain insight into our evolution using ITSI with VictorOps.&lt;p/&gt;

We will discuss how incident responders can learn more about the attack and build out a timeline of key events. We will also explain how DNS based security plays an important role in proactively blocking threats and how integrations with Splunk can help you with effective threat hunting.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Effective Strategies for Monitoring Docker and Kubernetes Environments</comments>
      <description>Containerization and the adoption of microservices have dramatically accelerated software innovation. However, containerized environments behave so differently compared to traditional ones that they present new observability challenges, and require new monitoring strategies and tools. What are those challenges? In this talk, we will discuss three – the explosion in scale, massive component churn caused by continuous delivery, and the need for infrastructure-to-application correlation –  then share effective strategies for overcoming them in a number of practical examples.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Lost In Translation - The Challenge of Managing Microservices</comments>
      <description>Instana CEO Mirko Novakovic explores microservices applications and the performance management challenges created by their complexity. Unique microservice architectures, operational and deployment needs create a large management gap. With so many moving pieces in addition to highly complex architectures, having the raw data won’t meet the challenge. There’s just too many pieces, too many dependencies and too much data for humans (even teams) to understand. New management tools are needed that translate data into information. Otherwise, each stakeholder must fend for themselves even though the ephemeral application architecture makes it impossible to find bottlenecks. It’s like trying to get directions in a foreign city where nobody speaks your language - every question and answer gets lost in translation. Mirko examines distributed microservice applications, how their complexity creates management problems, and what APM tools should do to automatically meet those challenges and deliver high performing applications.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>Instana CEO Mirko Novakovic explores microservices applications and the performance management challenges created by their complexity. Unique microservice architectures, operational and deployment needs create a large management gap. With so many moving pieces in addition to highly complex architectures, having the raw data won’t meet the challenge. There’s just too many pieces, too many dependencies and too much data for humans (even teams) to understand. New management tools are needed that translate data into information. Otherwise, each stakeholder must fend for themselves even though the ephemeral application architecture makes it impossible to find bottlenecks. It’s like trying to get directions in a foreign city where nobody speaks your language - every question and answer gets lost in translation. Mirko examines distributed microservice applications, how their complexity creates management problems, and what APM tools should do to automatically meet those challenges and deliver high performing applications.</itunes:subtitle>

      <description>What in the world is this observability stuff all about? How is it different from monitoring or the other things we’ve been doing? This session will give you a crash course in observability, how to roll it out, how to practice and improve it, and how to ensure you’re getting the best bang for your buck. We’ll examine the goals, how people use the tools, and what benefits you can expect.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Securing the Intelligent Enterprise with SAP Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk</comments>
      <description>Looking to eliminate blind spots across your SAP environment and take proactive action to detect and mitigate attacks before mission-critical ERP applications are compromised? SAP recently teamed with Splunk to help a leading manufacturer build and validate a first-of-it’s-kind bi-directional integration between SAP Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk. See a demo of how Enterprise Threat Detection’s open, extensible framework enables an exchange of alerts with Splunk to facilitate real-time attack investigations from either platform plus the ability to rapidly take action within the SAP landscape or broader heterogenous infrastructure.SAP Enterprise Threat Detection is a powerful native SAP HANA application that quickly identifies suspicious patterns at the application server and database level. When a potential SAP software-specific threat is identified, Enterprise Threat Detection can send an alert to Splunk to correlate with other application and infrastructure data for deeper investigation or trigger immediate action. Conversely, InfoSec teams using Splunk to rapidly identify anomalies across the broader security infrastructure can send alerts to Enterprise Threat Detection for forensics or to trigger appropriate actions in the SAP environment. The combination of Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk enables organizations to more effectively combat security issues across the enterprise spanning applications and infrastructure.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In the new Splunk Cloud Platform, we’re reimagining the way we enable monitoring and alerting. Configure triggers to identify changes and anomalies in your data as they occur and determine the right action(s) that should be taken as a result – email, Slack, VictorOps, etc. Leverage machine learning to bring your attention to the right insights and roll that back into your core monitoring strategy.  Come to this session to learn more about both the long-term vision and what’s immediately available.&lt;p/&gt;
