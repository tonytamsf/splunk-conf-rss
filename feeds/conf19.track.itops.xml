      <comments>4 Easy Steps for Reclaiming Your Life (without quitting your job)</comments>
      <description>Everything breaks at 3:00 a.m. No one wants a team of engineers managing incidents on little to no sleep. Think about how tired you were the morning after the last all-nighter you pulled. Coffee can only do so much. If you work in any type of technical operations role you know how easy it is for on-call to take over your life. When managing an on-call team, you must think about the human side of on-call to avoid employee burnout and alert fatigue. In this session we will outline a four-step process to streamline incident management, review how to manage alerts through VictorOps, and give your team their lives back!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Accelerate your ability to sniff out application exceptions and detect outliers in performance KPIs</comments>
      <description>Are you frustrated with how long a Splunk time series query of your data can take when you need it now, and are you looking to use machine learning to quickly gain insights about your app’s performance? Finding application exceptions or detecting outliers in your performance KPIs too late can lead your business to suffer without the information it needs to make the right decisions in a timely manner. We will show you how we used the metrics index and machine learning capabilities in Splunk to make better alerts, build scheduled performance reports, and ultimately gain deeper insights and make better decisions based on our data. Sharing these insights as a weekly scheduled report helped our team find hidden issues, increase performance awareness, and maintain SLAs around performance KPIs. Additionally, better alerts operationally helped us to detect outliers in performance metrics within minutes after they occur. Join this session to see queries, demos and several examples for you to take back with you and implement this solution at your company. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Last year, at the Container Strikes Back session, Brent Boe and Brian Bingham introduced the new Splunk official container. Today, we’re talking about the benefits as well as the challenges we encountered adopting the “Splunk in containers!” strategy at the Ministry of Defence for both our testing and our production environments. Our small DevOps team tasked with deploying Splunk did not have the bandwidth to build a resilient and scalable Splunk deployment in a traditional way at the pace required. By consuming the official Splunk Docker image, taking advantage of SmartStore backed by AWS S3, making a liberal use of other AWS services, and with support from Splunk PS architects as well as communities around Splunk’s official GitHub repos, we were able to rapidly deploy a complex Splunk cluster in AWS with minimal overhead. This has allowed our project to keep to our tight deadlines around cloud migration, while also providing a monitoring platform that can be scaled out over time as adoption increases.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Customer Service is as Easy as Pie with ITSI</comments>
      <description>Do you need to support thousands of people every day logging into your organization’s web applications? Customer service is important to Penn State University (PSU), and Splunk ITSI offered the perfect solution for health monitoring and data sharing between executive management and subject matter experts within the WebAccess team. At PSU, WebAccess is the Single Sign-On (SSO) solution supporting over 140,000 students, facility, and staff. ITSI’s Service Analyzer showcases the relationships among various SSO components: Active Directory, CoSign, Duo Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Kerberos, and Shibboleth. Join us and learn how ITSI pioneered the recipe for PSU to isolate root cause slicing deep dives and allowed management to analyze performance on a glass table. Splunk’s ITSI continues to deliver valuable insights from back end systems to front end user interfaces, improving customer service. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Models: Bridging the Knowledge Gap to Work with Complex Data … Even Mainframe Data! </comments>
      <description>Do you have complex or obscure data?  Do users, without the necessary domain knowledge, struggle to work with this data?  Perhaps a Data Model can help bridge the knowledge gap.  This session will use valuable (but complex…and even scary) mainframe metrics as a working example of how to get users up and running fast by leveraging the power of a data model.  But, these principles are not just for mainframe.  They can equally apply to other data types and scenarios.  Not all users are well-versed in complex data structures and fields, but some are…so combine Subject Matter Expert (SME) knowledge with this great Splunk facility to make everyone’s life simpler.  Deliver real results in a very short time with little overhead or burden on users.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Are you addressing the challenges of gaining visibility into a distributed microservices environment? Is your organization considering using distributed tracing to augment your APM capabilities? Have you heard of OpenTracing and want to learn what capabilities it gives you and how to get started? Come learn about the OpenTracing project and how you can use it with Splunk to get a complete picture of your application environment using logs, metrics, and traces. We&#x27;ll go from the basics of what the project is to how to get started integrating with Splunk. We&#x27;ll also review an example of a large telco customer to see how they got started with OpenTracing and how they rolled it out in their application environments.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Is your team spending too much time investigating common business and engineering questions due to a lack of transparency into your rapidly growing distributed system? Is logging for your microservices a haphazard mess? Is isolating a single event workflow throughout the pipeline just TOO MUCH WORK? Learn how we utilized Splunk to simplify troubleshooting distributed systems at Bloomberg. In this session, we will: Walk through some custom components that provide transparency into complex distributed microservices; show how to utilize them to find and isolate a single event workflow; explain how to write highly-optimized Splunk SPL queries to answer various business workflow questions; and demonstrate how to present the results using advanced visualizations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Effective Strategies for Monitoring Docker and Kubernetes Environments</comments>
      <description>Containerization and the adoption of microservices have dramatically accelerated software innovation. However, containerized environments behave so differently compared to traditional ones that they present new observability challenges, and require new monitoring strategies and tools. What are those challenges? In this talk, we will discuss three – the explosion in scale, massive component churn caused by continuous delivery, and the need for infrastructure-to-application correlation –  then share effective strategies for overcoming them in a number of practical examples.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Every Minute Counts: Integrating Splunk and VictorOps to Accelerate Incident Response</comments>
      <description>Splunk/VictorOps allows your data to talk to people, and your people to talk to data, all while improving MTTR/MTTI. You’re already using Splunk today to get cool dashboards, ask questions of your data with search, and trigger important alerts based on data that’s of interest to you. But, just because alerts are important doesn’t mean they are for everyone. And for those who should respond to the alert, it’s important to get the alert into their hands immediately. Transitioning to a modern NOC, or “New Operations Center,” Splunk and VictorOps enable teams to collaboratively solve issues by providing on-call users with actionable alerts that allow for smarter investigation, faster mobilization, and lower mean time to resolution. In this session we’ll take a look under the hood at different Splunk and VictorOps integrations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>“Excuse Me! Your Microphone isn’t on” – supporting 400 teaching spaces with Splunk &amp; ITSI – A case study</comments>
      <description>Do you remember the time when you had to attend lectures in person? Monash University has extended teaching hours and stopped repeating lectures. To provide flexibility to students and release pressure on finite campus facilities, lectures are now live streamed and are guaranteed to cover 100% of the classroom content. We are using Splunk and IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) to help monitor live streaming of lectures. It is impossible to manually monitor hundreds of teaching spaces in real-time and keep track of lecture schedules, the status of AV devices, microphones, and audio signals. Come and see how we at Monash University use Splunk ITSI glass tables to rule them all! Using ITSI we get real-time insights into service health and entity-level alerting based on ITSI thresholds.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>At Mastercard, we assist our banks in making sure their cardholders are protected from fraud attacks on their cards. We process tens of thousands of transactions per second all within tens of milliseconds. When our platform has outages (big and little), we need to understand how the problem occurred so we can prevent future issues and provide the best service possible. I will provide a detailed use case of a past incident, our challenges and how Splunk helped us find the culprit and make changes to our platform and processes to prevent the issue in the future.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Fiserv Turns ITSI Up to 11 – with Powerful KPIs, Better Performance, &amp; Custom Alerts</comments>
      <description>ITSI provides a platform to turn your never-ending stream of app and infrastructure data into manageable KPIs that you can act on, but how do you manage the number of events ITSI detects? What if you need to extend ITSI with additional capabilities in order to merge your alerts with your support team&#x27;s response processes? We will turn ITSI up to 11 by adding the concept of &quot;platforms&quot; as a collection of related services, support reoccurring maintenance windows, and generate rich alerts that include information such as which entities are impacted and what the KPI values are. These concepts are combined so that all the problems in your platform generate a single alert with alert text rich enough that that your support teams can respond without opening ITSI, and we will do it all with just SPL.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How S&amp;P Global Migrated to the Cloud with Splunk</comments>
      <description>S&amp;P Global is undergoing a cloud transformation. As we continue to mature in the  cloud, we are  partnering with Splunk to enable monitoring that is accurate, timely, and actionable. The cloud transformation project was aggressive, and we have exited our primary data centers and have nearly migrated 100% of applications to the cloud within eight months. We are building in the cloud using infrastructure automation, DevSecOps, and continuous monitoring. The cloud environment is by no means simple. It continues to be complex because some applications have migrated to be cloud-native while others are lift and shift. In addition, we are moving to containers and multi-cloud. All those teams use Splunk to monitor for issues and investigate root causes. By integrating and automating our IT services, we have reduced MTTI and MTTR, and increased our productivity. We will share details about our successful implementation story, and provide steps to help you achieve monitoring maturity in changes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Improved Methods for Using Selenium with Splunk to Monitor Web Apps</comments>
      <description>Using data that you probably already have in Splunk, you can gain tremendous insight into the performance of your web applications. However, this requires someone to visit your application, and ideally you don&#x27;t want your customers discovering your problems for you. What happens when nobody is looking? What if a part of the site is broken but users just haven&#x27;t tripped over it yet?  We&#x27;ll demonstrate the methods that we developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory using Splunk and open source tools like Selenium to monitor web applications with synthetic interactions that happen in a real browser to verify everything is performing as expected. We&#x27;ll share how to put the pieces together, including configuring Selenium Grid, creating monitoring that thoroughly tests your apps, dashboards that create and test your Selenium interactions for you, getting screenshots and network waterfall data, and our monitoring dashboards that combine test results with existing Splunk data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Infrastructure and System Monitoring with Splunk and Telegraf</comments>
      <description>Telegraf is a open source tool that is used for collecting metrics from a variety of inputs, including system data (CPU, memory, disk, and network), docker, MySQL, etc. Telegraf (as of v1.8) supports a &quot;splunkmetric&quot; serializer for native ingest into Splunk&#x27;s metric store using a variety of Telegraf&#x27;s output modules, including file outputs, and HTTP with the ability to include HEC-required fields. Telegraf can be deployed as a stand-alone daemon or as a Splunk application that can be pushed out from deployers, masters, and the like. We&#x27;ll investigate the various integrations with Telegraf and Splunk including using Telegraf as the system to feed Splunk&#x27;s App for Infrastructure (in lieu of collectd), custom dashboards, as well as integrations with ITSI. With Telegraf&#x27;s multitude of inputs, outputs, and a nearly universal run-time, it&#x27;s a fantastic tool to add to your system monitoring workflows.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Infrastructure Insights: Reducing Time by Shining a Light on Siloed IT Landscapes</comments>
      <description>In a highly virtualized environment, getting a clear picture of the infrastructure landscape can be challenging. Because data is siloed between each layer of IT, discovering their relationships is often a manual task involving multiple teams. But using Splunk, building those relationships becomes a breeze. Join us as we discuss how we combine data from the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), Virtual Infrastructure, and Storage Environment to present an easy-to-use interface that allows our users to explore their infrastructure. Troubleshooting issues that used to take a user hours of downloading and parsing data from multiple sources now takes seconds with a click of a button. From finding all applications running on one host to determining which teams to notify for upcoming storage work, we can now quickly show all meaningful relationships between applications, servers, hosts, and storage.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Kubernetes Observability with Splunk Connect for Kubernetes (SCK)</comments>
      <description>Kubernetes is the go-to standard for the automation of deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications. From an observability perspective it is extremely difficult to analyze, troubleshoot and gain actionable insights from these containerized applications. We bridge this gap of observability with the open-sourced Splunk Connect for Kubernetes. Splunk Connect for Kubernetes is the Splunk supported integration to ingest logs, metrics and Kubernetes object state information into Splunk. This session is intended for k8s users and developers who want to make their lives easier leveraging Splunk alongside Kubernetes. Come join the developers who built Splunk Connect for Kubernetes and learn how to configure and run Splunk to monitor your Kubernetes environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Los Angeles World Airports - Streamlining event management with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI)</comments>
      <description>Los Angeles World Airport has chosen Splunk&#x27;s ITSI as their centralized event/alert management platform. We’ve consolidated alerts/events from multiple management platforms across the enterprise, reducing help desk churn by grouping similar events, and evaluating the results against smart Key Performance Indicator (KPI) thresholds so that only actionable alerts or events are processed. In addition, we’ve broken down the legacy data siloes through the use of service definitions, glass tables, and deep-dives, providing better insight for all team members. Lastly, we’ve automated ITSI service and dependency creation via the Splunk ServiceNow bi-direction integration App. Plan top attend this session and you will learn how we’ve increased visibility (making data available for everyone); increased efficiency by reducing alert/event noise; improved resolution using ITSI Smart KPIs; and implemented auto service creation via ServiceNow &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Monitoring your VMWare vSphere Environment with Splunk</comments>
      <description>Siloed IT monitoring for Virtualization struggles to scale as teams use different tools to monitor the same IT environment, increasing complexity and decreasing productivity. Imagine analysts, admins and virtualization teams collaborating and troubleshooting on a single platform. No more finger pointing, no more “my tool says”, no more data disagreements. Use Splunk for centralized infrastructure monitoring of your virtualized environment. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Predict Real World Outage using Splunk MLTK</comments>
      <description>Do you want to predict an outage before it happens? Are you wondering how to pursue the incremental journey to Artificial Intelligence Operations (AIOps)? This case study will reveal a real-world use case from T-Mobile USA and show you how to predict cell tower congestion in advance using Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit. In the age of binge watching on cell phones and wireless broadband services, cell congestion reduces speed and reliability and results in buffered video streaming and/or dropped calls that dents the use of services and the revenue. Building forecasting models for congestion requires correlation of several parameters including seasonal variations. Doing this on a large scale in real time takes significant resources. In this session, attendees will learn about the journey to build this predictive capability, including data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, benefits, and lessons learned. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Real-world strategies for Kubernetes &amp; docker integrations with Splunk</comments>
      <description>Have you jumped on the Kubernetes train and are now thinking about your logging strategy? Or are you considering migrating your application to a microservices architecture like Docker and want to proactively plan your logging strategy? The data capture methods and data format can be significantly different from what you used in the past. Additionally, multi-line events need to be accounted for. There are a few different ways to ingest this data into Splunk. For example, Splunk &#x27;Kubernetes Connect&#x27; leverages Fluentd behind the scenes. There also is a Splunk logging plugin for docker, and a syslog logging plugin. The Splunk Universal Forwarder also can be deployed on a sidecar. What the pros and cons with so many choices? This session will help you sort it all out.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Remediation-as-a-Service with Splunk ITSI</comments>
      <description>A large volume of known production incidents and end-user issues are still being resolved manually. This becomes worse when it happens in unusual hours and no one is there to fix it. Every minute of downtime is detrimental to business and waking up an engineer at the middle of the night to fix simple known issues is not worthwhile. Our self-healing (Event-Driven Remediation) solution fixes simple and known incidents automatically. For complex alerts, it gets relevant diagnostics and context from the logs. This could massively improve customers&#x27; and employees&#x27; experience in any organization.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Your network is speaking to you! Listen to what your applications are saying. Monitoring the metrics already present in your wire data can provide the key to understanding and characterizing their performance. Using tools like Splunk Stream, you can collect dozens of metrics at the IP, TCP, and Application layers. This session will show you how to characterize the performance of your applications and the network, and how to tell which is the source of trouble. We&#x27;ll also explore how to perform service and asset discovery with wire data as a basis of fact, correlating it with your database &quot;of record&quot; to ensure its accuracy.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk as a Tool for DevOps Acceleration</comments>
      <description>DevOps adoption requires high performing teams. One of the biggest challenges organizations have when adopting a DevOps framework is how to get early wins, get value early in the process, and overcome plateaus in adoption. These improvements are typically achieved through the use of automation, improved responsiveness, better situational awareness, and increased sharing between teams. As you will see in this session, Splunk easily sits in the middle of all of this.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Unified Observability with OpenTelemetry</comments>
      <description>We now live in a Cloud Native world where we build and deploy software very differently from the previous generation. Large, centralized systems are being decoupled and distributed to address scalability needs and to allow companies to deliver value faster. Compared to monolithic applications, microservice architectures introduce complexity in network communication, feature much shorter life cycles, and require resiliency in dynamic environments. As companies began to build or migrate to microservice architectures they often run into operational complexity and struggle to efficiently monitor their environments. These challenges have highlighted the need to observe systems differently and lead to the rise of Observability. In this session, we will discuss OpenTelemetry and how it provides visibility into both distributed traces and metrics. We will walk through the architecture including client libraries and collection as well as cover key concepts including annotations, sampling policies and more. Live demos and coding examples will be presented through the talk. By the end of the session, you will know what OpenTelemetry is, why it is important, how you can get started and how you can get involved.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Splunk and its premium solution to accelerate DevOps lifecycle</comments>
      <description>As more technology organizations pursue agility and move towards continuous delivery, a stable and reliable IT infrastructure is the foundation that enables the transformation. However, the increasing complexity of the underlying infrastructure also brings a lot of challenges. Splunk has built a variety of solutions on top of our platform to deal with this complexity and deliver analytics and troubleshooting data to our engineering teams and decision makers. We will share a bit about our continuous integration process for triaging automated tests using Splunk, how we build IT infrastructure monitoring/analytics system based on Splunk ITSI, and how we take corresponding actions via VictorOps.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Want to Turbocharge your Developer Pipeline?</comments>
      <description>Do you want to help your developers waste less time on issues and spend more time optimizing build times using Splunk? Do you want to improve developer satisfaction while cutting build times by 35% on a long-established and entrenched code base? Then join us to hear how Jira developers at Atlassian, the world leader in software collaboration tools, did just that. We will explain how we used Splunk Enterprise to collect metrics as structured events from developer machines to improve our Maven build times for several hundred developers. We aggregated, analyzed, and visualized these events to not only identify and resolve performance bottlenecks as they occurred across our developer pipeline, but also to pinpoint the next big thing to tackle; a dream result for us. Not a Maven user? No worries. The approaches we will cover are good for any developer setup, allowing you to jump start build time improvements while generating the continuous insights you need to do more with less time and less waste. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Why Dinosaurs Make Bad Pets: Legacy Monitoring Tools and their Extinction – TIAA Adopts ITSI as their new MoM</comments>
      <description>Too many tools, too many silos between data and collaboration, Outages take too long to Identify Root Cause and There is So Much Noise Abstract:  TIAA had a goal – to replace Legacy Monitoring with an AIOps approach.  What did that mean?  They had to find a better way to break down the silos between data and collaboration and start focusing attention on the right things with the right people.  Monitoring had become about MTTI (mean time to innocence) instead of fixing the fight issues more quickly and finding a way to move from ‘reacting’ to outages to ‘preventing’ them.  ITSI has become the ‘aggregator’ of monitoring data and will help TIAA move from the old Dinosaur Approach of being event driven to the AiOps approach of Service and Priority Driven.  Learn about the Journey, the Lessons Learned, and the Best Practices to Ensure Success.   &lt;p/&gt;
