      <description>Would you be able to detect a sophisticated adversary targeting your Kubernetes clusters and workloads tonight? How do busy teams with stacked backlogs find time to learn how to attack Kubernetes clusters, detect those attacks, and build defenses to reduce the attack surface? We will demonstrate an effective purple team methodology that &quot;uses every part of the buffalo&quot; by 1) executing attacks on Kubernetes using the open source tool Peirates, 2) tracking the attack artifacts from the adversary simulation in Splunk, 3) teaching the defenders how the attack was performed and where to look for forensic artifacts, and 4) working together in the purple-est way possible to improve detection and response capabilities using Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Peirates.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you love the idea of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, but you’re not sure how to use it in your Splunk-centric security program? This talk will teach you practical ways to use the framework in your own organization and the Splunk security tools that will help you do so. We&#x27;ll start the talk by identifying an adversary and some of their known techniques, and then we&#x27;ll show how to choose an appropriate set of detections and how to test whether those detections are working as expected. You&#x27;ll leave the talk better able to take advantage of threat intelligence, cover the right set of ATT&amp;CK™ tactics and adversary groups, and eliminate organizational blind spots.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>Do you love the idea of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, but you’re not sure how to use it in your Splunk-centric security program? This talk will teach you practical ways to use the framework in your own organization and the Splunk security tools that will help you do so. We&#x27;ll start the talk by identifying an adversary and some of their known techniques, and then we&#x27;ll show how to choose an appropriate set of detections and how to test whether those detections are working as expected. You&#x27;ll leave the talk better able to take advantage of threat intelligence, cover the right set of ATT&amp;CK™ tactics and adversary groups, and eliminate organizational blind spots.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Automate Your Phishing Response with Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Machine Learning</comments>
      <description>We developed an automation framework that classifies and mitigates emails reported to the SOC. The framework acts as an engine that consumes multiple data sources, including a supervised machine learning model and a risk scoring algorithm to assess with high confidence if an email is phishing, spam, or benign. We will discuss the benefits of our approach to phishing mitigation, such as enhancing our SOC&#x27;s ability to automatically identify, prioritize, and mitigate malicious phishing attempts against employees before any damage is done.  The session will outline the overall design of the framework, detail the primary components that are used within Splunk Phantom and Splunk Enterprise Security, and will outline the supervised machine learning model that we trained to aide the automation engine.  &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>So you have a SIEM with security data, e.g. firewalls, proxy, endpoint data, etc. Now what? How do you effectively operationalize your investment? This session provides recipes, principles, patterns, and strategies for using Splunk and data-driven analytics to move your security monitoring and compliance effectiveness up the maturity curve. This session will cover how to identify key mixes of data sources, core OOTB content to use, and how to layer capabilities aligned with your maturity. We will help you go beyond the endless alerts and investigations and start creating value by reducing the impact of potential security events. We&#x27;re excited to show you that there&#x27;s no need for a PhD in security assurance and operations—just Splunk and a solid plan.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Advanced attackers that live off your land add insult to what can be very serious injury. In this session we&#x27;ll show you how to use behavioral analysis to identify advanced attackers that evade traditional signature-based detection methods. We do so in our organization by using Splunk to combine insights from traditional data sources to detect activity across multiple phases of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework. We&#x27;ll focus on how to build queries  tune them for your environment, and start catching these threat actors with behavioral detections as soon as you get back from .conf.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Where did you come up with the idea for your last use case? Traditional approaches to use case ideation focus on identifying new use cases based on the data already available to the security operations center. However, the threat landscape is constantly changing, and attackers are constantly getting more sophisticated. To detect these advanced threats, our use cases must be based on both business and threat context. In this session, we will share our approach to building innovative use cases based on real-world threats. Starting with industry-specific threat intelligence, we identify the threat actors and their specific tactics, techniques, and procedures. With these insights, we identify use cases relevant to the business, map them to both existing and new data sources, and prioritize implementation based on the specific threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In this session, we tackle data breaches and information exfiltration from cloud file stores. Beyond the attacks that make headlines and result in millions of stolen personal records, we will also focus on the far less publicized risks related to exposure of intellectual property, infrastructure details or finances. We will share our experience in building a defensive strategy that now detects highly-covert exfiltration attempts.To this end, we first shed a lot of light on how companies use general-purpose file stores, such as Box, Office365 or Google Drive. We cover the types of files that commonly get stored in the cloud, file sharing practices, access properties, as well as uses of cloud stores by various departments. There are a lot of unexpected insights which eventually invalidate common security assumptions.As the boundary between good and bad gets blurred, we will provide you with a peek into how to design an effective data-driven defense. This approach helped us hone our detection to just tens of validly suspicious exfiltration files in a massive cloud store.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Models: Bridging the Knowledge Gap to Work with Complex Data … Even Mainframe Data! </comments>
      <description>Do you have complex or obscure data?  Do users, without the necessary domain knowledge, struggle to work with this data?  Perhaps a Data Model can help bridge the knowledge gap.  This session will use valuable (but complex…and even scary) mainframe metrics as a working example of how to get users up and running fast by leveraging the power of a data model.  But, these principles are not just for mainframe.  They can equally apply to other data types and scenarios.  Not all users are well-versed in complex data structures and fields, but some are…so combine Subject Matter Expert (SME) knowledge with this great Splunk facility to make everyone’s life simpler.  Deliver real results in a very short time with little overhead or burden on users.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Onboarding: Where do I begin?</comments>
      <description>How do I get data into Splunk? What is a sourcetype? Does Splunk already know how to handle my data? What app do I use? What if all my data is syslog? If you are asking these questions, then this session is for you. After all, data quality is the foundation of becoming a data-driven organization. This session will walk through onboarding fundamentals. We will discuss the importance of a timestamp and what to do if your data may not have one. We will explain when to use an existing or create a new sourcetype. We will review the process of examining an app from Splunkbase and determining what sourcetype the app expects. By the end of this session you will no longer use syslog as a sourcetype, but as a means of collecting data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Malware infection, lateral movement, data exfiltration, oh my! If you’ve spent any time around the wizarding world of security, you know how much effort goes into preventing dark magic from happening. What if you could use machine learning to stay one step ahead of the adversary? Fasten your seatbelts, because in this talk we will show you how Splunk can utilize machine learning models to take your security detections to the next level. We’ll demonstrate how Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit can be used to train, validate, and then deploy models to identify anomalies and discover clusters of bad behavior via user-friendly guided workflows—all this while training your models with more data then you’ve ever been able to before. Prepare to leave Las Vegas equipped to incorporate machine learning in your organization’s security detections and jump from reactive to proactive. Mischief managed! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Have you ever been positive you had found evil, only to realize it was normal after hours of triage and work? We have all heard and love “KNOW NORMAL FIND EVIL,” but how hard is it to actually know normal? The MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework gives defenders a better map to “find evil,” but how can this framework be used to “know normal”?Rick will discuss how knowing normal in a world of abnormal is harder than one thinks, and how addressing the actual root cause of evil can improve the technology industry as a whole.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>Have you ever been positive you had found evil, only to realize it was normal after hours of triage and work? We have all heard and love “KNOW NORMAL FIND EVIL,” but how hard is it to actually know normal? The MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework gives defenders a better map to “find evil,” but how can this framework be used to “know normal”?Rick will discuss how knowing normal in a world of abnormal is harder than one thinks, and how addressing the actual root cause of evil can improve the technology industry as a whole.</itunes:subtitle>

      <description>Splunk&#x27;s Incident Management Framework is used extensively in support of the notable event creation, and it serves as a bridge that associates the Risk, Asset &amp; Identity, and Threat frameworks together. In this session we will discuss how incident management functions, what occurs behind the scenes to prepare events that are correlated, and how to present correlated events to analysts. Attendees will leave this talk with a greater understanding of the Incident Management Framework and methods to work more effectively with it within Splunk Enterprise Security.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>20+ million subscribers, 290PB network traffic daily, and tens of millions of IoT, IPTV and ICT devices—a bigger network means more attacks from all over the world. Learn how SK Broadband, the biggest telco/ISP provider in South Korea, leverages Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) to protect their subscribers from countless DDoS and malware attacks. We will cover detailed use cases for analyzing a high volume of data—500 million security events over 7 billion logs per day—as well as how we met a high bar of operational efficiency by customizing our ES deployment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Getting Started with Risk-Based Alerting and MITRE</comments>
      <description>Risk-based alerting is gaining traction in the SOC: by using multiple-lower fidelity searches to yield higher-fidelity investigations, it allows analysts to rapidly prioritize investigations, correlate “risk objects” between alerts, identify gaps in monitoring, and generally understand attack narratives. We&#x27;ll discuss the first steps needed to transition from the traditional one-to-one ticket investigation model to this holistic approach, i.e. how risk-based alerting works, a description of prerequisites, and dashboard optimization.  We will also discuss how to start building a comprehensive search inventory based on Splunk analytics, MITRE, and your own threat intelligence.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Attackers are increasingly using a &#x27;living off the land&#x27; approach, often using crypto mining malware, EternalBlue, timing, or other attacks that leverage the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line. These attacks typically don&#x27;t generate any events via conventional Sysmon and PowerShell, so even if you&#x27;re pulling in those logs you likely won&#x27;t see them. Join this session to learn how to detect and protect your organization from these advanced WMI-based attacks.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>This session will illuminate the world of Intellectual Property (IP) so that women are more empowered to gain recognition. The underrepresentation of women in STEM has meant that, historically, men have had a reputational advantage, but women can gain ground. IP rights provide an avenue for increased acknowledgement, both inside and outside the company. This session will cover the issues of ownership as well as the different types of IP, and which IP may be most valuable to the company. It also will explain the role of an IP group in a company, and how women can take advantage of their efforts to see their contributions being acknowledged. It also will discuss the business pressures at play, with different company groups and products vying for limited resources. The goal of this session is to give women the information and tools they need to take advantage of opportunities, gaining the much-deserved recognition they deserve, and boosting their professional career in technology!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How We Scaled Splunk Enterprise Security to 100TB with Search Head Clustering</comments>
      <description>Want to scale Splunk Enterprise Security to 100TB/day? We&#x27;ve done it! In Splunk labs, we built workloads that closely simulate our customers&#x27; usage patterns, and we scaled beyond a 100TB per day ingest rate with search head clustering. In this session we&#x27;ll share key aspects of our Splunk Enterprise Security workload design: diverse source types, major data models, search scenarios, data enrichment, and hardware choices for search head and indexer.  We will also share how different configurations impact search performance and how to tune Splunk Enterprise Security effectively with parameters such as max_searches_per_cpu, acceleration.max_concurrent, allow_skew, and maxBundleSize to name a few. Come see how we scaled to large volumes while efficiently utilizing hardware capacity for maximum performance.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>How do you know if your alerting and response processes adequately cover the tactics and techniques that your adversaries will use against you? If you&#x27;re not sure, then how do to you continuously improve to adapt to ever-evolving threats? This session will provide practical guidance on leveraging models like the diamond model, MITRE ATT&amp;CK™, and OODA to deconstruct your monitoring and response program so that you can make strategic improvements and mature it on a strong foundation. Using these frameworks will help your team recognize its own bias in developing use cases, understand how its alerting and response coverage maps to adversary tactics/techniques, and develop and prioritize new use cases. The session will wrap up discussing practical tips for creating a continuous improvement program that helps you leverage Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk Phantom to maintain a strong security posture.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>The digital convergence of IT and OT infrastructures promises huge efficiencies, cost savings and opportunities; but it is not without risk. OT was primarily built to run all types of manufacturing &amp; critical infrastructure processes while IT was built to store, transmit and manipulate data in order to conduct business. The two worlds could not be more different in purpose or design; and this can expose even the most secure organizations to new types of cyber threats. In this session we will discuss the current challenges we face in the drive to convergence and how to secure your industrial or critical infrastructure organization from the clear and present threat.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>IOC&#x27;s: Indicators Of Crap</comments>
      <description>“You should be looking at Indicators of Compromise!” exclaims your CISO, regulator, vendor, and mom.  No problem, right? You have the most expensive security intelligence vendor and all you have to do is correlate in your expensive SIEM. If you&#x27;ve tried this, then you are laughing with me. Come hear my exploration into implementing IOCs at a major US insurance company and a major US bank. I’ll address the differences between Indicators of Compromise vs Indicators of Attack, and I will show you how not to use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, plus some tips on how it use it well.  My goal is to save you from falling into the same pitfalls when dealing with Indicators of Crap.&lt;p/&gt;

“You should be looking at Indicators of Compromise!” exclaims your CISO, regulator, vendor, and mom.  No problem, right? You have the most expensive security intelligence vendor and all you have to do is correlate in your expensive SIEM. If you&#x27;ve tried this, then you are laughing with me. Come hear my exploration into implementing IOCs at a major US insurance company and a major US bank. I’ll address the differences between Indicators of Compromise vs Indicators of Attack, and I will show you how not to use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, plus some tips on how it use it well.  My goal is to save you from falling into the same pitfalls when dealing with Indicators of Crap.

      <comments>Klapp-Back at Attackers: Capturing Data in the Wild to Build Tailored Defenses with Splunk Security Analytics</comments>
      <description>Splunk&#x27;s Security Research Team collects attack data in the wild from across the globe and analyzes new and unusual techniques, tactics, and procedures employed by threat actors. We use this data to help customers build tailored defenses—defenses that automatically detect, investigate, and respond to suspicious activities in real time. In this session we will discuss how Splunk security researchers created our own honeypot and data collection framework in response to research demonstrating that honeypots were twice as effective as open-source intelligence feeds at detecting new threats (http://tinyurl.com/y335po8d). We will provide an introduction to honeypots and explain how we architected and built KLAPP-Back, a high-interaction SSH honeypot. We will also discuss how KLAPP-Back helped us build better detection analytics and seed Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Splunk User Behavior Analytics use cases with attacker data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Large Scale Threat Hunting in Splunk</comments>
      <description>Threat hunting is hard, and threat hunting in an enterprise network with thousands of endpoints is even harder. We will demonstrate how we leveraged Splunk Enterprise to build an Advanced Threat Hunting platform designed for large scale threat hunting of 100,000 or more endpoints. Using Splunk Enterprise allows us to combine analytics, data enrichment, and custom workflows to display in one platform the most important data to analysts. Our threat hunting platform addresses the challenges of data retention and collection, high false positive rates, and analyst fatigue, all while lowering the time to detection of malicious incidents and improving the efficiency of enterprise SOC operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Lessons Learned From Building a Threat Detection Program</comments>
      <description>We will share experiences and best practices for implementing notable events, the various Splunk Enterprise Security frameworks, and adaptive response actions, and we&#x27;ll share our approach for building a program to consistently develop, measure, and iterate on correlation searches. We will discuss how to integrate lessons learned from incidents, red team engagements, threat intelligence, threat hunting, and requirements from business units into the program. Example tactics we&#x27;ll cover include leveraging low-fidelity detections to develop higher-fidelity and higher-value ones, managing detection content simply and easily through macros, and building a formula to assess the efficacy of your detection content. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Modernize and Mature Your SOC with Risk-Based Alerting</comments>
      <description>Today SOCs are in desperate need of a different alerting approach. Texas Instruments (TI) decided to transform its SOC by using risk-based alerting to generate fewer, higher fidelity alerts, and by aligning to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, which provides more situational awareness to analysts. This risk-based approach reduces false positives and the situational numbness associated with the legacy whitelisting process. Splunk and TI will walk you through TI&#x27;s SOC successes as it transitioned to risk-based alerting. TI will detail a few real-life risk-based rule examples, discuss learning curves to fast track your transition, and discuss how MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ fits in with this approach.  After this session, you will have the foundation to embark on your risk-based alerting journey, allowing you to increase detection mechanisms, increase your coverage of the ATT&amp;CK™ techniques, and improve the overall effectiveness of your SOC.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>The Census is the nation’s largest peacetime mobilization effort and determines congressional representation. Census data is used by businesses, governments and civic organizations to inform decision-making and this year the Census is going mobile and online for the first time. This means that security is a top priority in ensuring the success of the 2020 Decennial. This segment of the conference will explore security related topics to include vulnerabilities, scalability and performance, with a special focus on Data Privacy, Compliance and Reputational Threat Management. If all things data and IT Security excite you, then this session is for you. Census executives Atri Kalluri and Zack Schwartz will provide a behind the scenes overview of the systems supporting the 2020 Decennial, including Splunk, and real world case studies on how the Census Bureau is adopting best practices across IT security and social media monitoring to ensure the security of respondent data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Many government agencies and for-profit companies require that you run Splunk on a network disconnected from the outside Internet. This presents many challenges, including how to cross air gaps and one-way transfers, how to operate indexers in an air-gapped environment, and how to automate backwards. This session will cover lessons learned from a variety of air-gapped deployments.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Saving the Nation’s Food Supply with Data-Driven Analytics</comments>
      <description>Copper River ES, a strategic partner for Splunk public sector, is working with a large federal agency that has restructured their NOC and SOC organizations into a single unified entity as part of operational optimization.  The agency is responsible for protecting IP and other assets totaling $4.3 trillion as part of safeguarding the nation’s food supply chain.   The goal was to enhance the ability to handle problem escalations quickly and improve communications between teams. They are currently ingesting more than 3TB daily across 65 data sources where Splunk is leveraged as an integrated data platform and framework service to act as a nerve center for the combined NOC and SOC teams. Implementation has resulted in dramatically reducing MTTD to an average of less than 30 min compared to previous times of up to 12 hours, MTTR times from 16 hours to often less than 1 with overall outage times having now been reduced by about 68%. From a security perspective, it is used to identify data exfiltration and insider threats, as well as for security operations and compliance.  Increasing visibility into all aspects of system operations and troubleshooting efforts is now supported through a series of custom Splunk App’s, glass tables, reports and alerts with operational guides and training to best leverage the capabilities Splunk has generated.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As the types of devices and applications used in IT organizations increase exponentially, scaling the analytics-driven SOC becomes even more imperative. In this session Splunk Professional Services will help you learn from its past experiences architecting Splunk Enterprise Security environments for scale into the terabytes per day. We will share technical details on improvements to search technology and Data Model Acceleration in Splunk Enterprise that will help you increase performance and decrease total cost of ownership. We will also take a deep dive under-the-hood into Splunk Enterprise Security Frameworks in which you should make special considerations for high volume.  Finally, we&#x27;ll share important metrics on how to monitor the ongoing health of your Enterprise Security deployment, ensuring you stay on track over time, even in periods of rapid growth.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Scary (Spooky?) Fast Intelligence-Based Hunting with Splunk Phantom</comments>
      <description>Organizations today struggle with quickly and consistently applying behavior-based threat intelligence across their security tools. The hours needed to stitch together this information manually leave analysts unprepared to quickly turnaround questions from management about their vulnerability to threats that their management sees in the news. In this session we will demonstrate how to use Splunk Phantom to reduce that time lag by automating your threat hunts. Specifically, we will show you how to use Yet Another Recursive Algorithm (YARA) rules on endpoint and network security tools automatically and simultaneously. We will use a case study to show the benefits achieved from this playbook: better reporting, more robust procedures, faster time to detect malware variants, and generally more efficient and effective threat hunts.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know. With vast amounts of cloud data coming in at cloud-speed, it can be difficult to see through the noise and know what to look for. Are malicious adversaries attempting to comprise the environment? Is my environment under- or over-provisioned? Do I have an insider possibly exfiltrating company data? Are employees actually using the services? What is all of this costing per service, department, business unit? Don&#x27;t worry, we will help you figure all this out in a prescriptive manner by showcasing these and other use cases. Then, we will show you the &quot;how&quot; by exposing the searches, the data needed, and showing you how to onboard that data. You will walk away with use cases that can be implemented immediately in your own environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>IBM i systems are used by many customers in a number of industries such as banking, retail, transportation and hospitality. Splunk is a perfect tool for consolidating and analyzing event, security, performance, and application data from these critical IBM i systems. Having a single and complete view of infrastructure data allows operations, security, and performance analysts to quickly identify and correlate operational, security, and performance issues. Syncsort Ironstream™ for Splunk can easily capture the needed event, security, and performance data in real time. Detailed performance data from these IBM i systems combined with Splunk’s machine learning algorithms can provide a new degree of confidence in capacity planning.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk Enterprise is powerful. Don&#x27;t cheat yourself of its power. When making decisions as to how to expand or standup Splunk’s footprint, you need to know what matters when making platform decisions. Considering compute, storage, virtualization, cloud infrastructure is a lot. There isn’t one place to review all the options you have. We will share the Splunk way to think of performance and how it relates to the underlying system resources. This means getting into the real nuts and bolts of performance. If you want to know how search affects indexing and what resources get consumed, this is the session to attend. If you also want to know how it affects what you purchase as a platform choice, this also is the session to attend. We also will review how partners have built architectures to simplify this process.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Step Up Your Defenses with End-To-End Detection, Investigation, and Response</comments>
      <description>Maturing and scaling your security operations rests on your ability to process and analyze huge volumes of often unrelated data in real time. But today&#x27;s tools notoriously overwhelm SOC analysts with the sheer number of alerts and high percent of false positives, resulting in confusion about what tools to use for investigation and response. In this session, members of Splunk&#x27;s Security Research Team will discuss the next generation of Enterprise Security Content Updates that they developed, which integrate the entire Splunk for Security product suite to create a robust end-to-end defense—detection, investigation, and response. We will go over how to use these security guides, which will leverage Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Splunk User Behavior Analytics. We&#x27;ll also highlight the Run Story feature we built to operationalize ESCU Analytics stories and share tools and techniques customers can use to write and test their own use cases.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Survival of the Fastest: The 1-10-60 Rule</comments>
      <description>Winston Churchill once said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.&quot; Then again, Churchill wasn’t in cybersecurity...While our successes are certainly never final, our failures can absolutely be fatal—to a company and our continued employment. What&#x27;s a good way to actually measure success and failure, though, outside of not appearing on the front page of the paper? Well, as CrowdStrike notes, you have on average one minute to detect an attack in progress, ten minutes to understand it, and sixty minutes to contain it. We will show how to use this 1-10-60 Rule as a measuring metric and leverage the data and capabilities within Splunk and its ecosystem to ensure that we win the survival of the fastest.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>We&#x27;ve run a risk-based approach with our security alerts for over a year, and we&#x27;re excited to review our progress with you. We&#x27;ll discuss how we increased the number of behavioral indicators by 300% while reducing our alerts by 50%. We&#x27;ll also discuss how we expanded our risk approach to handle on premise and cloud environments within the same framework, which yielded a single alerting mechanism that leverages all of our data enrichment. We&#x27;ll also share the roadmap for our risk-based approach, which incorporates risk rules that utilize algorithms to identify risks not discovered by traditional detection approaches.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Have you ever wondered what Joe meant when he referred to “Wire Data”? Today, you&#x27;ll see the applicability of wire data in your organization, and you&#x27;ll be amazed. Solve fraud, cybersecurity, ops, and business challenges, all with one single source of data. Wire data is the information that passes over computer and telecommunications networks to define communications between client and server devices. It is the result of decoding wire and transport protocols containing the bi-directional data payload. We will cover the use of wire data to solve security, IT operations, and business use cases, and see how the Splunk Stream platform is easily integrated into your existing data flows. The Splunk Essentials for Wire Data app from Splunkbase will be used to showcase dozens of examples using wire data to solve common business and technical issues. We will cover how to deploy and configure Splunk Stream in a distributed environment, including a demonstration.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The SOC of the Future</comments>
      <description>This presentation will discuss how Security Operation Centers (SOCs) will need to change to meet the cybersecurity challenges of the 2020s. The speaker will draw on his experience as a founder of the first SOC-as-a-Service company that delivers managed security services using Splunk. Most industry analysts envision that the next generation of SOCs will leverage AI, Big Data, and the Cloud, but how far can automation take us and is the concept of an autonomous SOC really practical?

This presentation will discuss how Security Operation Centers (SOCs) will need to change to meet the cybersecurity challenges of the 2020s. The speaker will draw on his experience as a founder of the first SOC-as-a-Service company that delivers managed security services using Splunk. Most industry analysts envision that the next generation of SOCs will leverage AI, Big Data, and the Cloud, but how far can automation take us and is the concept of an autonomous SOC really practical? How will the SOC of the Future address the global shortage of cyber professionals? How will the role of security analysts need to change? Will the SOC of the Future still need to be housed in dedicated physical facilities?

      <comments>Threat Hunting in Industrial (ICS\OT) Environments</comments>
      <description>Industrial operations comprise a diverse blend of technology that run critical processes. The proliferation of automation and networking has increased the sophistication of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), also known as Operational Technology (OT) environments.Threats targeting OT are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. Dragos tracks 9 OT-targeting activity groups, the most significant of which, XENOTIME, was responsible for the TRISIS malware that targeted safety systems (SIS) resulting in multiple plant shutdowns and the potential to cause harm to human operators.Traditional IT threat hunting is not well-suited to OT environments. This session will outline the differences between IT and OT assessments, highlight the most significant threats facing OT, and review best practices for OT-specific threat hunting engagements, including techniques that empower defenders to detect and respond more efficiently to existing and future threats, therefore reducing adversary dwell time.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Intel is transforming its approach to security by deploying a new Cyber Intelligence Platform (CIP) based on Splunk, Kafka, and other leading-edge technologies. Our new platform ingests data from hundreds of data sources and security tools, providing context-rich visibility and a common work surface, and improving the efficiency of our entire information security organization. This session will address how we partnered with Splunk architects to deploy and realize benefits from this solution in just five weeks. We will detail how our solution uses real-time data, streams processing, machine learning tools and consistent data models to decrease time to detect and respond to sophisticated threats. This session will cover everything from our platform&#x27;s business value to its solution architecture.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Obtaining data to develop defenses against threats is a constant challenge for security analysts. To that end, Splunk&#x27;s Security Research team developed the Splunk SIEMulator, a framework modeled after Chris Long&#x27;s DetectionLab that allows a defender to replay attack scenarios using AttackIQ in a simulated environment. SIEMulator’s Attack Range environments are all configured with Splunk forwarders and the apps necessary to create and store data in CIM data models. We&#x27;ll show you how to use the SIEMulator to produce shareable data that can help security analysts replicate scenarios and effectively detect, investigate, and respond to threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Splunk and DNS to detect that your domains are being abused for phishing</comments>
      <description>As a high-profile public-sector organization, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration deals with criminals claiming to be representatives of the organization and contacting the public with phishing e-mails every day. By using Splunk and RFC’s like, RFC7208 – Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, we have developed a technique to identify phishing attacks that are carried out under the disguise of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This technique is universally applicable. A precondition is access to the DNS logging. By means of this technique, insight can be obtained where the phishing e-mails are sent from and to whom the phishing e-mails are sent. In this talk we will start by explaining which standards are available to increase e-mail security and how we have build an app in Splunk, including dashboard and a wizard to create the necessary DNS records to gain insight information about the abuse of our domains.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>As a high-profile public-sector organization, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration deals with criminals claiming to be representatives of the organization and contacting the public with phishing e-mails every day. By using Splunk and RFC’s like, RFC7208 – Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, we have developed a technique to identify phishing attacks that are carried out under the disguise of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This technique is universally applicable. A precondition is access to the DNS logging. By means of this technique, insight can be obtained where the phishing e-mails are sent from and to whom the phishing e-mails are sent. In this talk we will start by explaining which standards are available to increase e-mail security and how we have build an app in Splunk, including dashboard and a wizard to create the necessary DNS records to gain insight information about the abuse of our domains.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Using Splunk to Catch Theft Rings</comments>
      <description>We helped our client use Splunk to disrupt theft rings plaguing its retail stores. We&#x27;ll present how we took in public wifi data, tracked MAC addresses that appeared in multiple stores, and ultimately created a system in Splunk that alerted in-store loss prevention teams when individuals likely to be involved in theft rings entered the store. We&#x27;ll go over the steps taken to operationalize our theft deterrence program so that you can adopt it in your organization or modify it to fit your needs.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Never used Splunk before, have no Splunk admins and you’ve just bought Splunk Enterprise Security? That was us, and now we&#x27;re using Splunk in ways that we could&#x27;ve only dreamed of using IBM QRadar. In this session we’ll share our implementation story, how we worked with Splunk to accelerate our learning curve, and how we went from 0 to 3TB in 3 months with no Splunk admins. We&#x27;ll also cover how Splunk allows us to onboard data sources that we couldn&#x27;t with QRadar. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Does your small team also run a full-featured SOC that supports a global company? In this session we’ll show you how we’ve used Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security to bring together all the relevant security intelligence from our technology stack, transforming our security operations from ad hoc and tactical to strategic and compliance-driven. We’ll discuss key takeaways from our journey, such as the benefits of ingesting data properly from the outset so you can reap the rewards as you scale; how we leverage multiple use cases out of single data sources; and how we created easy-to-understand visualizations that convey our firm’s security posture to management.&lt;p/&gt;
