      <comments>Accelerate your ability to sniff out application exceptions and detect outliers in performance KPIs</comments>
      <description>Are you frustrated with how long a Splunk time series query of your data can take when you need it now, and are you looking to use machine learning to quickly gain insights about your app’s performance? Finding application exceptions or detecting outliers in your performance KPIs too late can lead your business to suffer without the information it needs to make the right decisions in a timely manner. We will show you how we used the metrics index and machine learning capabilities in Splunk to make better alerts, build scheduled performance reports, and ultimately gain deeper insights and make better decisions based on our data. Sharing these insights as a weekly scheduled report helped our team find hidden issues, increase performance awareness, and maintain SLAs around performance KPIs. Additionally, better alerts operationally helped us to detect outliers in performance metrics within minutes after they occur. Join this session to see queries, demos and several examples for you to take back with you and implement this solution at your company. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Agent Based Modeling for CryptoFinance in Splunk</comments>
      <description>Cryptocurrency ecosystems are highly complex, distributed, and rapidly evolving, rendering many existing financial models ineffective. By aggregating the heterogeneous data streams that are produced by distinct groups within crypto (blockchains, mining pools, exchanges, etc.), we have built a unified analytical platform called Nakamoto Terminal (NTerminal) using Splunk. By leveraging NTerminal, we are creating an adapted agent-based modeling (ABM) system; agents monitor the state of the ecosystem by consuming real time updates from the individual data sources that modulate their state and connectivity. Different heuristic models are called upon to facilitate data transformations and agent interactions. Within this ecosystem, collective agent activity reveals emergent properties and patterns of behavior. With Splunk as the centerpiece, integrated reports, dashboards, or searches allow you to better navigate the ecosystem of interest.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>Cryptocurrency ecosystems are highly complex, distributed, and rapidly evolving, rendering many existing financial models ineffective. By aggregating the heterogeneous data streams that are produced by distinct groups within crypto (blockchains, mining pools, exchanges, etc.), we have built a unified analytical platform called Nakamoto Terminal (NTerminal) using Splunk. By leveraging NTerminal, we are creating an adapted agent-based modeling (ABM) system; agents monitor the state of the ecosystem by consuming real time updates from the individual data sources that modulate their state and connectivity. Different heuristic models are called upon to facilitate data transformations and agent interactions. Within this ecosystem, collective agent activity reveals emergent properties and patterns of behavior. With Splunk as the centerpiece, integrated reports, dashboards, or searches allow you to better navigate the ecosystem of interest.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>A healthcare company changing lives with Splunk</comments>
      <description>This session is about a healthcare company born from cybersecurity using Splunk to disrupt the traditional healthcare delivery model. Accuhealth has created a remote patient monitoring platform to analyze health and biometric data collected from IoT devices to improve the patients&#x27; quality of life. A doctor is alerted in real-time of any abnormal changes to their patient&#x27;s vitals and have immediate access to medical trends, allowing the doctor to make faster and more informed decisions. Splunk is at the nerve center of our platform. Using machine learning and health data, the tool provides actionable insights and predictive analysis to patients, doctors, caregivers, and researchers. Additionally, we have leveraged Splunk to integrate the three pillars of telehealth: Telemedicine, Chronic Care Management, and Remote Patient Monitoring. Learn first hand and see a demo of how Accuhealth is creating a paradigm shift in healthcare. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you love the idea of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, but you’re not sure how to use it in your Splunk-centric security program? This talk will teach you practical ways to use the framework in your own organization and the Splunk security tools that will help you do so. We&#x27;ll start the talk by identifying an adversary and some of their known techniques, and then we&#x27;ll show how to choose an appropriate set of detections and how to test whether those detections are working as expected. You&#x27;ll leave the talk better able to take advantage of threat intelligence, cover the right set of ATT&amp;CK™ tactics and adversary groups, and eliminate organizational blind spots.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Automate Your Phishing Response with Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Machine Learning</comments>
      <description>We developed an automation framework that classifies and mitigates emails reported to the SOC. The framework acts as an engine that consumes multiple data sources, including a supervised machine learning model and a risk scoring algorithm to assess with high confidence if an email is phishing, spam, or benign. We will discuss the benefits of our approach to phishing mitigation, such as enhancing our SOC&#x27;s ability to automatically identify, prioritize, and mitigate malicious phishing attempts against employees before any damage is done.  The session will outline the overall design of the framework, detail the primary components that are used within Splunk Phantom and Splunk Enterprise Security, and will outline the supervised machine learning model that we trained to aide the automation engine.  &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Beyond Tier 1 Automation: The Hidden Value of Splunk Phantom Automation for Security Operations </comments>
      <description>You&#x27;ve probably heard examples of Splunk Phantom automating 90% of Tier 1 processes, but did you know that Phantom improves human-lead processes too? Come learn about the hidden value of validation and utility playbooks from Penn State University’s Enterprise Security Manager and Splunk’s Lead Technologist for Higher Education. Validation playbooks are automated tests run to validate a human judgement or request. Utility playbooks are short easy-to-create playbooks in Phantom that an analyst  runs during an investigation.  We’ll cover when to use validation and utility playbooks, how to get started creating them, and ideas for other playbooks you can use to improve your daily operations. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Build Automated Decisions for Incident Response with Splunk Phantom</comments>
      <description>Incident response (IR) analysts are required to make multiple decisions on every alert and incident. Whether the decision is to escalate, respond, or to discard the alert, each one of those decisions is critical to protecting their environment. With the integration of SOAR platforms like Splunk Phantom into IR teams, many of those decisions can now be automated for analysts. These decisions can save hours of work for analysts and allow for focus on more critical alerts. However, there are still questions to answer before implementing these decisions. What data is needed to make confident decisions? Where in the process should these decisions be made? How can existing decisions be improved? How should new decisions be integrated? The General Electric IR team has worked to answer these questions by using Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Phantom. In this session, we will show how our team approached these questions, implemented solutions, and integrated decisions for our analysts to save time and focus their efforts.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Advanced attackers that live off your land add insult to what can be very serious injury. In this session we&#x27;ll show you how to use behavioral analysis to identify advanced attackers that evade traditional signature-based detection methods. We do so in our organization by using Splunk to combine insights from traditional data sources to detect activity across multiple phases of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework. We&#x27;ll focus on how to build queries  tune them for your environment, and start catching these threat actors with behavioral detections as soon as you get back from .conf.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Production of crystal and gemstones requires high-class, top-quality output and unmatched quality and accuracy in the E2E production line. Based on in-depth experience, our joint client is one of the leading providers of production line machinery, serving its own business units as well as industry customers with precision optical instruments, grinding, sawing, drilling, and dressing tools. The new technical innovations in the area of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offer completely new options to improve smart production lines. Thus Accenture is partnering with Splunk on creating a roadmap to build a fully digital, smart factory that will become a world-leading lighthouse facility. This session will provide insights into how the power of data enabled by Splunk can realize a quantum step in modern production line environments. It also will help you understand the value of data science for predictive quality, digital twin scenarios, reduced lot size, and closed loop R&amp;D processes. &lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>Production of crystal and gemstones requires high-class, top-quality output and unmatched quality and accuracy in the E2E production line. Based on in-depth experience, our joint client is one of the leading providers of production line machinery, serving its own business units as well as industry customers with precision optical instruments, grinding, sawing, drilling, and dressing tools. The new technical innovations in the area of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offer completely new options to improve smart production lines. Thus Accenture is partnering with Splunk on creating a roadmap to build a fully digital, smart factory that will become a world-leading lighthouse facility. This session will provide insights into how the power of data enabled by Splunk can realize a quantum step in modern production line environments. It also will help you understand the value of data science for predictive quality, digital twin scenarios, reduced lot size, and closed loop R&amp;D processes. </itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Building threat-driven use cases for the real world with iDefense intelligence</comments>
      <description>Where did you come up with the idea for your last use case? Traditional approaches to use case ideation focus on identifying new use cases based on the data already available to the security operations center. However, the threat landscape is constantly changing, and attackers are constantly getting more sophisticated. To detect these advanced threats, our use cases must be based on both business and threat context. In this session, we will share our approach to building innovative use cases based on real-world threats. Starting with industry-specific threat intelligence, we identify the threat actors and their specific tactics, techniques, and procedures. With these insights, we identify use cases relevant to the business, map them to both existing and new data sources, and prioritize implementation based on the specific threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Catch exfiltration from cloud file stores early!</comments>
      <description>In this session, we tackle data breaches and information exfiltration from cloud file stores. Beyond the attacks that make headlines and result in millions of stolen personal records, we will also focus on the far less publicized risks related to exposure of intellectual property, infrastructure details or finances. We will share our experience in building a defensive strategy that now detects highly-covert exfiltration attempts.To this end, we first shed a lot of light on how companies use general-purpose file stores, such as Box, Office365 or Google Drive. We cover the types of files that commonly get stored in the cloud, file sharing practices, access properties, as well as uses of cloud stores by various departments. There are a lot of unexpected insights which eventually invalidate common security assumptions.As the boundary between good and bad gets blurred, we will provide you with a peek into how to design an effective data-driven defense. This approach helped us hone our detection to just tens of validly suspicious exfiltration files in a massive cloud store.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if SPL had a debug mode?! We think so too, which is why we created SPL Rehab. This new app allows you to step through your search on a per-command basis, visualize key figures from the job inspector and search log, and show you how your overall output is affected! We will also show you how the tool works under the covers and how you can apply some useful dashboarding tricks to your own apps!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>&quot;Did we just lose ALL our knowledge objects? Do you know how much time and energy that was?&quot; After a destructive resync, Paychex lost two months of its knowledge object creations/modifications. We learned to be prepared if it were to ever happen again. How? It&#x27;s easier than you might think, and you don&#x27;t have to be an admin. You’ll learn how to proactively save your work (dashboards, reports, data models, MLTK experiments, ITSI glass tables, macros, views, etc.) and audit changes when they occur. You will leave the session knowing how to manage the ever-increasing amount of things you create. You&#x27;ll also have solutions that can save you time and effort from having to recreate lost/modified objects, including how to restore service faster. You also will come away with peace of mind knowing that you can take control of safeguarding and protecting your work, thereby covering your assets when a disaster happens.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you have complex or obscure data?  Do users, without the necessary domain knowledge, struggle to work with this data?  Perhaps a Data Model can help bridge the knowledge gap.  This session will use valuable (but complex…and even scary) mainframe metrics as a working example of how to get users up and running fast by leveraging the power of a data model.  But, these principles are not just for mainframe.  They can equally apply to other data types and scenarios.  Not all users are well-versed in complex data structures and fields, but some are…so combine Subject Matter Expert (SME) knowledge with this great Splunk facility to make everyone’s life simpler.  Deliver real results in a very short time with little overhead or burden on users.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Onboarding: Where do I begin?</comments>
      <description>How do I get data into Splunk? What is a sourcetype? Does Splunk already know how to handle my data? What app do I use? What if all my data is syslog? If you are asking these questions, then this session is for you. After all, data quality is the foundation of becoming a data-driven organization. This session will walk through onboarding fundamentals. We will discuss the importance of a timestamp and what to do if your data may not have one. We will explain when to use an existing or create a new sourcetype. We will review the process of examining an app from Splunkbase and determining what sourcetype the app expects. By the end of this session you will no longer use syslog as a sourcetype, but as a means of collecting data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Deep Dive: How to use Splunk to protect the environment</comments>
      <description>Can Splunk help eliminate environmental risks and save the company money at the same time? The Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) sets standards defining the amount of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that can be safely released. Honda Manufacturing of Alabama (HMA) must adhere to those standards and track our compliance within the parameters set forth by the ADEM. Failure to comply with these standards will result in potentially damaging the environment and large fines. HMA uses a Regenerative Thermal Oven (RTO) to burn off pollutants from our paint department, which is controlled by an Allen Bradley Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Using this PLC and the sensors built into the RTO, we collect individual chamber temperatures, fan speeds, exhaust temperatures, motor winding temperatures, motor vibrations, and fan vibrations. Using these readings and the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit we try to predict if the temperature will be within the set range. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Deep Dive on The New Dashboarding &amp; Content Export Experience</comments>
      <description>This session provides detailed guidance on how to use the new dashboard framework into Splunk apps. It first goes over the basic get started tutorial, which helps developers to build a dashboard in just a few minutes. Then it dives deep into the overall architecture, technology stacks, and individual components that can be customized, including layouts, visualizations, data sources, inputs, event handlers. By attending this session, Splunk app developers will be able to integrate dashboards into the apps flexibly and reliably. This session will also walk through the best practices that can help developers to build the optimal dashboards. This session is targeted to both new Splunk app developers and existing Splunk app developers. For people who already know about the existing Splunk technology stack such as Backbone, SimpleXML, SplunkJS, this session will also go through how to migrate to the new framework. As a bonus, this session will also talk about how to export dashboards as beautiful images and PDFs that 100% matches the original ones! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Malware infection, lateral movement, data exfiltration, oh my! If you’ve spent any time around the wizarding world of security, you know how much effort goes into preventing dark magic from happening. What if you could use machine learning to stay one step ahead of the adversary? Fasten your seatbelts, because in this talk we will show you how Splunk can utilize machine learning models to take your security detections to the next level. We’ll demonstrate how Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit can be used to train, validate, and then deploy models to identify anomalies and discover clusters of bad behavior via user-friendly guided workflows—all this while training your models with more data then you’ve ever been able to before. Prepare to leave Las Vegas equipped to incorporate machine learning in your organization’s security detections and jump from reactive to proactive. Mischief managed! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As organizations look to extend Splunk to new datasets for business process insights, it is crucial to have the right data to work with. However Splunk teams can get stuck demonstrating the value of new solutions without having data available. Some very intelligent approaches to data sampling, data preparation, and query optimization can dramatically accelerate your ability to create value from more data.  In this session, you will learn some of these techniques so you can quickly make a business case and demonstrate the value for Splunk Business Flow in your organization.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Are you addressing the challenges of gaining visibility into a distributed microservices environment? Is your organization considering using distributed tracing to augment your APM capabilities? Have you heard of OpenTracing and want to learn what capabilities it gives you and how to get started? Come learn about the OpenTracing project and how you can use it with Splunk to get a complete picture of your application environment using logs, metrics, and traces. We&#x27;ll go from the basics of what the project is to how to get started integrating with Splunk. We&#x27;ll also review an example of a large telco customer to see how they got started with OpenTracing and how they rolled it out in their application environments.&lt;p/&gt;

We&#x27;ll also review an example of a large telco customer to see how they got started with OpenTracing and how they rolled it out in their application environments.</itunes:subtitle>

      <description>Wouldn’t it be a great if we had Splunk’s version of Moneyball; an application where everyone comes out ahead by leveraging data to drive effective Splunk enablement and adoption? Splunk’s internal logs have a wealth of information about how Splunk is being used within your organization. Let’s take drinking the “Splunk Champagne” to the next level by applying statistics and machine learning to Splunk’s internal logs! This session will cover segmenting users based on their search profiles - number of searches run, average response times, and recency of searches executed, among other criteria. We’ll use techniques such as clustering to classify users from novice to experts, and use TF-IDF and text analytics techniques to understand commands used in search strings. Enriching this data with completed and planned Splunk Education courses, lunch &amp; learn sessions, and other training activities will enable your users to achieve the Splunk Ninja status they’re looking for! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>So, you have Splunk in your enterprise but people aren&#x27;t using it. What do you do? After working with many organizations in financial services, we have heard the response &quot;yes, we use Splunk.&quot; However, there is a large gap between the organizations that have a Splunk license and those that are truly using Splunk. What is the key to successful adoption of Splunk as an enterprise tool? In this session hear how FIS has driven an uptake\in Splunk adoption across multiple business lines and external clients. Using Splunk, FIS have supported off-prescription solutions including system parameter inquiry, operator fraud, financial invoicing, client conference data analytics, staff resource allocations, and status reporting.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Is confidence in your ability to disassociate real alerts from noise at an all-time low? Are alerts becoming ineffective because they’re excessive? Many organizations across many industries wrestle with these questions daily. Even so, the prevalence of alert noise persists. Join us to understand how T-Mobile is using Splunk Enterprise with the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit to identify and narrow the point of origin of service-impacting events across our suite of enterprise applications. Using the DensityFunction algorithm to highlight anomalous behavior, we’re able to focus an investigation on a small subset of the applications which in turn leads to faster resolution of the issues we’re confronted with. &lt;p/&gt;

Using the DensityFunction algorithm to highlight anomalous behavior, we’re able to focus an investigation on a small subset of the applications which in turn leads to faster resolution of the issues we’re confronted with.

      <itunes:subtitle>Is confidence in your ability to disassociate real alerts from noise at an all-time low? Are alerts becoming ineffective because they’re excessive?

      <description>20+ million subscribers, 290PB network traffic daily, and tens of millions of IoT, IPTV and ICT devices—a bigger network means more attacks from all over the world. Learn how SK Broadband, the biggest telco/ISP provider in South Korea, leverages Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) to protect their subscribers from countless DDoS and malware attacks. We will cover detailed use cases for analyzing a high volume of data—500 million security events over 7 billion logs per day—as well as how we met a high bar of operational efficiency by customizing our ES deployment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk/VictorOps allows your data to talk to people, and your people to talk to data, all while improving MTTR/MTTI. You’re already using Splunk today to get cool dashboards, ask questions of your data with search, and trigger important alerts based on data that’s of interest to you. But, just because alerts are important doesn’t mean they are for everyone. And for those who should respond to the alert, it’s important to get the alert into their hands immediately. Transitioning to a modern NOC, or “New Operations Center,” Splunk and VictorOps enable teams to collaboratively solve issues by providing on-call users with actionable alerts that allow for smarter investigation, faster mobilization, and lower mean time to resolution. In this session we’ll take a look under the hood at different Splunk and VictorOps integrations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you remember the time when you had to attend lectures in person? Monash University has extended teaching hours and stopped repeating lectures. To provide flexibility to students and release pressure on finite campus facilities, lectures are now live streamed and are guaranteed to cover 100% of the classroom content. We are using Splunk and IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) to help monitor live streaming of lectures. It is impossible to manually monitor hundreds of teaching spaces in real-time and keep track of lecture schedules, the status of AV devices, microphones, and audio signals. Come and see how we at Monash University use Splunk ITSI glass tables to rule them all! Using ITSI we get real-time insights into service health and entity-level alerting based on ITSI thresholds.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>It’s a bird, it’s a plane. Yes, it’s a plane! Let’s go for a flight into the skies of aviation data and the concepts and tools that make aviation data analytics easy. I’ve been capturing this open data for nearly two years, and I’ve been able to unravel some insights based on four projects. Two projects focus on processing Canadian/U.S. safety reports, while the other two are processing data captured and logged from a radio receiver made from a Raspberry Pi. Data Science is offering very exciting careers and providing an important competitive differentiator, which is why we’ll be reviewing several statistical processing techniques made possible by the power of the Machine Learning Toolkit. We also will cover exploratory data analysis tools built into the Search Processing Language. Before we approach for landing, we’ll show everything under the hood so that everybody can understand the things that make it fly. This is both a technical deep dive as-well-as a practical usage walkthrough.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>To secure the modern endpoint, you need sufficient data, the right visibility and analysis, and the technology necesary to stop an intrusion. We will leverage BOTSv4 data in this session to help you test and validate Splunk use cases related to hunting threats using endpoint data. We’ll cover several real world case studies as described in MITRE ATT&amp;CK™, and we will simulate adversary groups by executing a single Atomic test and building an elaborate chain reaction. We will then show you in Splunk how to confirm your data quality and confirm you have what you need to detect and evict an adversary from your environment. We will demonstrate practical hunt techniques using BOTSv4 data and how to raise the flag when data is missing or is not required.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>To secure the modern endpoint, you need sufficient data, the right visibility and analysis, and the technology necesary to stop an intrusion. We will leverage BOTSv4 data in this session to help you test and validate Splunk use cases related to hunting threats using endpoint data. We’ll cover several real world case studies as described in MITRE ATT&amp;CK™, and we will simulate adversary groups by executing a single Atomic test and building an elaborate chain reaction. We will then show you in Splunk how to confirm your data quality and confirm you have what you need to detect and evict an adversary from your environment. We will demonstrate practical hunt techniques using BOTSv4 data and how to raise the flag when data is missing or is not required.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Fiserv Turns ITSI Up to 11 – with Powerful KPIs, Better Performance, &amp; Custom Alerts</comments>
      <description>ITSI provides a platform to turn your never-ending stream of app and infrastructure data into manageable KPIs that you can act on, but how do you manage the number of events ITSI detects? What if you need to extend ITSI with additional capabilities in order to merge your alerts with your support team&#x27;s response processes? We will turn ITSI up to 11 by adding the concept of &quot;platforms&quot; as a collection of related services, support reoccurring maintenance windows, and generate rich alerts that include information such as which entities are impacted and what the KPI values are. These concepts are combined so that all the problems in your platform generate a single alert with alert text rich enough that that your support teams can respond without opening ITSI, and we will do it all with just SPL.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Forecasting Disk Usage with Machine Learning – So easy, even a cave-person can do it!</comments>
      <description>This presentation will walk users through how to use the machine learning toolkit to accurately forecast disk usage across their entire environment, giving them the exact day, month, and year when a server will run out of disk space. No more being awakened at 3:00 am for a bridge call due to a drive running out of disk. This process also can be used by capacity planning teams to select a future date and get a clear view of capacity across the business for all servers. Using machine learning to remove tech debt in an organization does not require a data scientist. You can do it if you have the right server metrics and the MLTK installed. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Risk-based alerting is gaining traction in the SOC: by using multiple-lower fidelity searches to yield higher-fidelity investigations, it allows analysts to rapidly prioritize investigations, correlate “risk objects” between alerts, identify gaps in monitoring, and generally understand attack narratives. We&#x27;ll discuss the first steps needed to transition from the traditional one-to-one ticket investigation model to this holistic approach, i.e. how risk-based alerting works, a description of prerequisites, and dashboard optimization.  We will also discuss how to start building a comprehensive search inventory based on Splunk analytics, MITRE, and your own threat intelligence.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Handling Expanding Data Sources &amp; Datacenter Migration While Strengthening the Nutanix Security Posture with Splunk and HCI</comments>
      <description>Nutanix implemented Splunk to improve operations and security. Attend this session to learn how we started small and grew our Splunk footprint, going from 80 GB/day to 700GB-1.8TB/day, to satisfy key IT and business needs. You will also learn how we leveraged Splunk and our own Nutanix infrastructure for a successful data center migration that involved over 2000 clients and 80+TB of data. We’ll share best practices and insights into running virtualized Splunk Enterprise on hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI). You’ll also learn about an app for Phantom, which we’ll demo, we built to provide security operations teams the ability to quickly contain a VM by stopping or suspending it, then safely starting it, plus the other workloads, like firewall, Docker (incl. Splunk Docker), ETL, etc., we run alongside Splunk on the same infrastructure stack. Whether you’re a Splunk user or own the infrastructure that supports your Splunk team, you’ll get details to help you in your job.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In a world full of AI, wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to foster some Natural Curiosity?  Coming from a Humanities background, I tend to look at data a little differently than most engineers and data scientists. Using Splunk I&#x27;m able to freely navigate through the data and explore different use cases. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Have No Fear, WMI Is Here: Identify Lateral Movement and Malicious Backdoors with Windows Management Instrumentation</comments>
      <description>Attackers are increasingly using a &#x27;living off the land&#x27; approach, often using crypto mining malware, EternalBlue, timing, or other attacks that leverage the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line. These attacks typically don&#x27;t generate any events via conventional Sysmon and PowerShell, so even if you&#x27;re pulling in those logs you likely won&#x27;t see them. Join this session to learn how to detect and protect your organization from these advanced WMI-based attacks.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Wouldn’t it be great if you can just be proactively told when your Splunk deployment needs your attention? Wouldn’t it be simply awesome to go to one place and know exactly what the problem is and how to resolve it? At Splunk we understand that every organization suffers the pain of throwing resources to keep the lights on for their infrastructure environment. Fortunately the new version of Splunk Monitoring helps you know when things are not performing as expected. You can now see health of deployment wide without affecting your search or indexing latency and go through guided set of checks curated from years of support experience to solve issues first hand. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Discover how 3M is using Splunk to get more value and insights from their mission-critical SAP deployment and its complex legacy environment. You can see how far we have we come and where  our vision will take us. Managing SAP is a complex and mission-critical challenge. With its proprietary and often-customized inner workings, SAP has become synonymous with complexity and has long been a difficult challenge for IT departments around the globe to manage. With even short outages carrying the potential of large impacts, it is more important than ever for large ERP customers to bring their systems management and monitoring practices into the data-driven world. In this session, learn what transformational outcomes have been and are being achieved as this 116-year-old global manufacturer partners with Splunk to embrace and overcome ERP and legacy operational data chaos.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How we understand your intent &gt; Splunk Natural Language Platform (NLP)</comments>
      <description>Understanding the intent of a natural language search is a major component of any natural language processing system. Although there are numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex problems in natural language processing, such as understanding intent also known as natural language understanding, very few of them discuss the challenges in production. In this session we take you on a journey from development to production of natural language understanding component of Splunk Natural Language Platform. We will discuss several engineering and data science challenges, and also provide holistic approaches to overcome those challenges. Attendees of the session should walk away with a deeper understanding of different state-of-the-art techniques, such as understanding the intent of a natural language search query, that can help them build their own applications in the natural language processing domain. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Infrastructure and System Monitoring with Splunk and Telegraf</comments>
      <description>Telegraf is a open source tool that is used for collecting metrics from a variety of inputs, including system data (CPU, memory, disk, and network), docker, MySQL, etc. Telegraf (as of v1.8) supports a &quot;splunkmetric&quot; serializer for native ingest into Splunk&#x27;s metric store using a variety of Telegraf&#x27;s output modules, including file outputs, and HTTP with the ability to include HEC-required fields. Telegraf can be deployed as a stand-alone daemon or as a Splunk application that can be pushed out from deployers, masters, and the like. We&#x27;ll investigate the various integrations with Telegraf and Splunk including using Telegraf as the system to feed Splunk&#x27;s App for Infrastructure (in lieu of collectd), custom dashboards, as well as integrations with ITSI. With Telegraf&#x27;s multitude of inputs, outputs, and a nearly universal run-time, it&#x27;s a fantastic tool to add to your system monitoring workflows.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>AV and conference technology may seem trivial to the traditional IT OPS engineer, but it is one of the most visible and expensive parts of an enterprise. Everyone from the CEO to even the new hires on their first day use the technology. At PSE we were able to leverage Splunk to help us build, maintain, and manage our enterprise AV program (and save a lot of money in the process). In this session you will learn how we used Splunk to make data-driven decisions that influence and shape a multi-million dollar AV program.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>In Transition: Helping Veterans Navigate the Transition to Technology Careers</comments>
      <description>More than 200,000 military service members return to civilian life each year in the United States alone, with many thousands more around the globe. Many are looking to build on their experiences, leveraging the technical training and skills acquired while working in the service to their country. Thousands more are looking to change direction. Both paths can lead to the Splunk community, where we have provided access to free training for thousands of veterans through our customers, partners, and more.

      <comments>Introduction to monitoring business operations with Acceleris’ party dashboard</comments>
      <description>Why should running a business feel any different than throwing a party? To demonstrate how Splunk can be used to monitor and manage business operations, the DATA Mavericks team at Acceleris has iteratively perfected its Party Dashboard. It started out as a gimmick at the inauguration party of the company&#x27;s new headquarters, but now the Party Dashboard demonstrates how Splunk’s dashboarding helps any team get real-time visibility into any operation. Join this session to learn why they chose the relevant metrics, how they collected and fed the data to Splunk, and what meaningful insights were generated as a fun introductory example of using Splunk to get visibility into your business operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>“You should be looking at Indicators of Compromise!” exclaims your CISO, regulator, vendor, and mom.  No problem, right? You have the most expensive security intelligence vendor and all you have to do is correlate in your expensive SIEM. If you&#x27;ve tried this, then you are laughing with me. Come hear my exploration into implementing IOCs at a major US insurance company and a major US bank. I’ll address the differences between Indicators of Compromise vs Indicators of Attack, and I will show you how not to use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, plus some tips on how it use it well.  My goal is to save you from falling into the same pitfalls when dealing with Indicators of Crap.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk&#x27;s Security Research Team collects attack data in the wild from across the globe and analyzes new and unusual techniques, tactics, and procedures employed by threat actors. We use this data to help customers build tailored defenses—defenses that automatically detect, investigate, and respond to suspicious activities in real time. In this session we will discuss how Splunk security researchers created our own honeypot and data collection framework in response to research demonstrating that honeypots were twice as effective as open-source intelligence feeds at detecting new threats (http://tinyurl.com/y335po8d). We will provide an introduction to honeypots and explain how we architected and built KLAPP-Back, a high-interaction SSH honeypot. We will also discuss how KLAPP-Back helped us build better detection analytics and seed Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Splunk User Behavior Analytics use cases with attacker data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Kubernetes is the go-to standard for the automation of deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications. From an observability perspective it is extremely difficult to analyze, troubleshoot and gain actionable insights from these containerized applications. We bridge this gap of observability with the open-sourced Splunk Connect for Kubernetes. Splunk Connect for Kubernetes is the Splunk supported integration to ingest logs, metrics and Kubernetes object state information into Splunk. This session is intended for k8s users and developers who want to make their lives easier leveraging Splunk alongside Kubernetes. Come join the developers who built Splunk Connect for Kubernetes and learn how to configure and run Splunk to monitor your Kubernetes environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Threat hunting is hard, and threat hunting in an enterprise network with thousands of endpoints is even harder. We will demonstrate how we leveraged Splunk Enterprise to build an Advanced Threat Hunting platform designed for large scale threat hunting of 100,000 or more endpoints. Using Splunk Enterprise allows us to combine analytics, data enrichment, and custom workflows to display in one platform the most important data to analysts. Our threat hunting platform addresses the challenges of data retention and collection, high false positive rates, and analyst fatigue, all while lowering the time to detection of malicious incidents and improving the efficiency of enterprise SOC operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Lessons Learned From Building a Threat Detection Program</comments>
      <description>We will share experiences and best practices for implementing notable events, the various Splunk Enterprise Security frameworks, and adaptive response actions, and we&#x27;ll share our approach for building a program to consistently develop, measure, and iterate on correlation searches. We will discuss how to integrate lessons learned from incidents, red team engagements, threat intelligence, threat hunting, and requirements from business units into the program. Example tactics we&#x27;ll cover include leveraging low-fidelity detections to develop higher-fidelity and higher-value ones, managing detection content simply and easily through macros, and building a formula to assess the efficacy of your detection content. &lt;p/&gt;

Example tactics we&#x27;ll cover include leveraging low-fidelity detections to develop higher-fidelity and higher-value ones, managing detection content simply and easily through macros, and building a formula to assess the efficacy of your detection content.

      <description>“There’s always a tension between one’s individual self—one’s million data points—and the statistical breakdown of your existence. It’s the awareness of this tension that I navigate each day.” I wrote this in response to the reveal that black employee representation across Splunk’s U.S. offices was only 3%. #RepresentationMatters and having a “seat at the table” are critical frameworks and tactics to improve diversity, and this panel discussion brings together a diverse cross-section of Splunkers to further explore these topics. Specifically, panel participants will use there statistical data points (e.g., 3%) as a foil to reflect on how they’ve leveraged their individual motivations to push for and create change within their particular role. We intend for the audience to leave stirred by the ideas this conversation will open up, and moved to ask themselves what they can do to create change or elevate others who’ve been underrepresented in their workplace.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Los Angeles World Airports - Streamlining event management with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI)</comments>
      <description>Los Angeles World Airport has chosen Splunk&#x27;s ITSI as their centralized event/alert management platform. We’ve consolidated alerts/events from multiple management platforms across the enterprise, reducing help desk churn by grouping similar events, and evaluating the results against smart Key Performance Indicator (KPI) thresholds so that only actionable alerts or events are processed. In addition, we’ve broken down the legacy data siloes through the use of service definitions, glass tables, and deep-dives, providing better insight for all team members. Lastly, we’ve automated ITSI service and dependency creation via the Splunk ServiceNow bi-direction integration App. Plan top attend this session and you will learn how we’ve increased visibility (making data available for everyone); increased efficiency by reducing alert/event noise; improved resolution using ITSI Smart KPIs; and implemented auto service creation via ServiceNow &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Security architectures typically involve many layers of tools and products that are not designed to work together, leaving gaps in how security teams bridge multiple domains to coordinate defense. The Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework (AOF) addresses these gaps by connecting security products and technologies from our partners with Splunk security solutions including Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) and Splunk Phantom. Join this session to learn how the Splunk AOF benefits both users and security technology providers by enabling rich context for all security decisions, collaborative decision-making, and orchestrated actions across diverse security technologies. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Maximizing permissioned blockchain throughput using Samsung SDS Accelerator and Splunk MLTK</comments>
      <description>Blockchain scalability is one of the main barriers to adoption of this revolutionary new technology. Finance, supply chain, and e-commerce blockchain deployments often have peak throughputs that far exceed their baseline. For example, when tickets for a popular concert go on sale, the peak transaction throughput will result in unacceptable latency for the users. Samsung SDS Accelerator is a layer 2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric that enables up to 10x transaction throughput during this burst of activity. Using Splunk MLTK, we’re able to detect and react to these bursts of activity without compromising the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Modernize and Mature Your SOC with Risk-Based Alerting</comments>
      <description>Today SOCs are in desperate need of a different alerting approach. Texas Instruments (TI) decided to transform its SOC by using risk-based alerting to generate fewer, higher fidelity alerts, and by aligning to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, which provides more situational awareness to analysts. This risk-based approach reduces false positives and the situational numbness associated with the legacy whitelisting process. Splunk and TI will walk you through TI&#x27;s SOC successes as it transitioned to risk-based alerting. TI will detail a few real-life risk-based rule examples, discuss learning curves to fast track your transition, and discuss how MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ fits in with this approach.  After this session, you will have the foundation to embark on your risk-based alerting journey, allowing you to increase detection mechanisms, increase your coverage of the ATT&amp;CK™ techniques, and improve the overall effectiveness of your SOC.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Next Generation Data Ingestion and Preparation with Splunk</comments>
      <description>You think data ingestion into Splunk is cumbersome today? Don’t enjoy writing Technology Add-ons (TA) for specific use cases? Then this talk is for you!  We will walk through data ingestion using the data sources supported by the new Splunk Investigate wizard. This allows users of all levels to configure their data source and perform various manipulation functions on the ingested data to make sure it meets their use case. We will also go over the guiding principles of the underlying Data Stream Processing (DSP) pipeline which empowers the user to add their own customizations and send data to a variety of destinations.   We will compare this with current Splunk Enterprise data ingestion process by configuring a TA for a specific use case and then alter the ingested data to the desired format before sending it to an index. The user will be able to draw a contrast between the two approaches and see how it does not have to take up to 6 weeks to acquire and prepare data for analytics in Splunk. We hope this session leaves the user excited about data ingestion and prep.    &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In this session, we’ll explore how companies can adapt to multi-cloud environments using Google Cloud Anthos and Splunk Enterprise to maintain end-to-end visibility into these hybrid workloads. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) On-Prem part of Anthos brings the efficiency, speed, and scale of cloud to manage Kubernetes clusters in your datacenter. Combined with Splunk Connect for Kubernetes, we’ll show you how you get a single pane of glass to manage, monitor &amp; secure your Kubernetes clusters across your organization. We’ll also do a deep dive on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) security controls and how to export security findings from Cloud Security Command Center and cloud asset changes from Cloud Asset Inventory all into Splunk Enterprise for further forensic analysis, to accelerate incident resolution and ensure compliance.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Protecting your Data: The 2020 Decennial Census and Data Security</comments>
      <description>The Census is the nation’s largest peacetime mobilization effort and determines congressional representation. Census data is used by businesses, governments and civic organizations to inform decision-making and this year the Census is going mobile and online for the first time. This means that security is a top priority in ensuring the success of the 2020 Decennial. This segment of the conference will explore security related topics to include vulnerabilities, scalability and performance, with a special focus on Data Privacy, Compliance and Reputational Threat Management. If all things data and IT Security excite you, then this session is for you. Census executives Atri Kalluri and Zack Schwartz will provide a behind the scenes overview of the systems supporting the 2020 Decennial, including Splunk, and real world case studies on how the Census Bureau is adopting best practices across IT security and social media monitoring to ensure the security of respondent data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>You knew it had to happen, Splunk is migrating to Python 3! We want this migration to be as painless as possible for apps and scripts developers, but it necessitates some compatibility requirements. This talk will dive into what parts of your apps and scripts will have to become Python 3 compatible. You’ll explore approaches to using Python community supplied backporting libraries as well as Python 2/3 compatible native syntax. By examining common and uncommon gotchas we found while migrating Splunk Enterprise, we will make sure you are prepared to run your code in the future generations of Splunk Enterprise!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Real-time public transport information systems monitoring and analysis in the city of Amsterdam </comments>
      <description>With around a million people interacting with the public transport in and around the city of Amsterdam daily, supplying accurate travel information is critical for an efficient and well-informed public transportation experience. With four different transport types (boat, bus, tram, and metro) and a host of custom systems creating around 4.5 million update events per day, analyzing this travel information depends on everything working seamlessly together. To provide accurate and trustworthy real-time passenger information services, monitoring of not only information availability but quality is needed. This use case shows how Splunk was implemented to monitor the data streams at all points in the information chain, and how real-time insights and alerting allows for proactive problem resolution and provides high-quality real-time information services for the end-user.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>A large volume of known production incidents and end-user issues are still being resolved manually. This becomes worse when it happens in unusual hours and no one is there to fix it. Every minute of downtime is detrimental to business and waking up an engineer at the middle of the night to fix simple known issues is not worthwhile. Our self-healing (Event-Driven Remediation) solution fixes simple and known incidents automatically. For complex alerts, it gets relevant diagnostics and context from the logs. This could massively improve customers&#x27; and employees&#x27; experience in any organization.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>A large volume of known production incidents and end-user issues are still being resolved manually. This becomes worse when it happens in unusual hours and no one is there to fix it. Every minute of downtime is detrimental to business and waking up an engineer at the middle of the night to fix simple known issues is not worthwhile. Our self-healing (Event-Driven Remediation) solution fixes simple and known incidents automatically. For complex alerts, it gets relevant diagnostics and context from the logs. This could massively improve customers&#x27; and employees&#x27; experience in any organization.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Running Splunk in an Air-gapped environment </comments>
      <description>Many government agencies and for-profit companies require that you run Splunk on a network disconnected from the outside Internet. This presents many challenges, including how to cross air gaps and one-way transfers, how to operate indexers in an air-gapped environment, and how to automate backwards. This session will cover lessons learned from a variety of air-gapped deployments.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Saving the Nation’s Food Supply with Data-Driven Analytics</comments>
      <description>Copper River ES, a strategic partner for Splunk public sector, is working with a large federal agency that has restructured their NOC and SOC organizations into a single unified entity as part of operational optimization.  The agency is responsible for protecting IP and other assets totaling $4.3 trillion as part of safeguarding the nation’s food supply chain.   The goal was to enhance the ability to handle problem escalations quickly and improve communications between teams. They are currently ingesting more than 3TB daily across 65 data sources where Splunk is leveraged as an integrated data platform and framework service to act as a nerve center for the combined NOC and SOC teams. Implementation has resulted in dramatically reducing MTTD to an average of less than 30 min compared to previous times of up to 12 hours, MTTR times from 16 hours to often less than 1 with overall outage times having now been reduced by about 68%. From a security perspective, it is used to identify data exfiltration and insider threats, as well as for security operations and compliance.  Increasing visibility into all aspects of system operations and troubleshooting efforts is now supported through a series of custom Splunk App’s, glass tables, reports and alerts with operational guides and training to best leverage the capabilities Splunk has generated.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Your network is speaking to you! Listen to what your applications are saying. Monitoring the metrics already present in your wire data can provide the key to understanding and characterizing their performance. Using tools like Splunk Stream, you can collect dozens of metrics at the IP, TCP, and Application layers. This session will show you how to characterize the performance of your applications and the network, and how to tell which is the source of trouble. We&#x27;ll also explore how to perform service and asset discovery with wire data as a basis of fact, correlating it with your database &quot;of record&quot; to ensure its accuracy.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know. With vast amounts of cloud data coming in at cloud-speed, it can be difficult to see through the noise and know what to look for. Are malicious adversaries attempting to comprise the environment? Is my environment under- or over-provisioned? Do I have an insider possibly exfiltrating company data? Are employees actually using the services? What is all of this costing per service, department, business unit? Don&#x27;t worry, we will help you figure all this out in a prescriptive manner by showcasing these and other use cases. Then, we will show you the &quot;how&quot; by exposing the searches, the data needed, and showing you how to onboard that data. You will walk away with use cases that can be implemented immediately in your own environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Solar Analytics: Changing the World One Solar Panel At A Time</comments>
      <description>Solar generation and energy storage is dramatically dropping in cost and is being deployed on a massive scale across the globe. However, system monitoring and diagnostics, cost reporting, and usage can be difficult. With Splunk Essentials for ICS (Industrial Control Systems) and Splunk IAI (Industrial Asset Intelligence), a smart energy solution easily can be created. Does it seem too hard to onboard data? See how we use the Splunk add-on builder to create technology add-ons for solar panels and batteries. Want better visibility? Using Splunk IAI, we can gain faster insights into the performance of solar panels, inverters, and battery systems. Want to understand the economics? By applying business analytics, we can easily report of revenue, costs, and total return on investment. This solution can be applied to both small and large solar and energy storage installations, and we have a real world use case with some exciting energy data!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>DevOps adoption requires high performing teams. One of the biggest challenges organizations have when adopting a DevOps framework is how to get early wins, get value early in the process, and overcome plateaus in adoption. These improvements are typically achieved through the use of automation, improved responsiveness, better situational awareness, and increased sharing between teams. As you will see in this session, Splunk easily sits in the middle of all of this.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk Cloud: optimizing performance, value and user experience</comments>
      <description>This session will cover how to overcome any missing insights in services and processes in Splunk Cloud. You&#x27;ll learn how to develop alerts and dashboards to show performance and infrastructure health, and an API framework to retrieve data from the cloud infrastructure. We also will show you how to automate retrieval of all entry points to the Splunk on-premises infrastructure, and monitor connections to the intermediate forwarders, deployment servers, HEC and DBX servers, and syslog. In addition, we will address the lack of standardization principles for your on-premises Splunk Infrastructure, how to create gold standard alerts and dashboards, and how to create scripted inputs to gather system information. Finally, we will show you how to address the lack of a centralized view for managing your Splunk deployment server infrastructure, and how to automate the retrieval of deployment clients, server classes, and TA’s from deployment servers and feed the output to Splunk Cloud.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunking Crime Part II - Analysing Bias in Police Actions</comments>
      <description>Last year at .conf18 we used Splunk and Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to analyze and predict the crime in London. This year we are taking a step forward and analyzing the bias in the police actions in the U.K. We will use police, population, religion, and race data to understand how police use their powers in different areas on people from different racial backgrounds. We will use open data sources and index them in Splunk. Using advanced visualizations we will analyze the data and understand more about police actions. Then using MLTK we will create a predictive model for crimes and then analyze the model for any bias due to the data provided. Machine bias is a real issue nowadays when machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used by government agencies to predict crime and even pass sentences on convicts. We need to understand that along with having positive impact of predicting crime, it can have a long-lasting negative impact as well.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk Machine learning and self healing at Priceline</comments>
      <description>Do you want to rely on manual intervention to fix your application if something goes wrong? In this deep-dive session you will learn how Priceline uses machine learning to find outliers and anomalies in various data sets, including but not limited to bookings, search patterns, changes in logging patterns, etc. You will learn how we used machine learning combined with predictive analytics to solve variety of use cases. For example, we collect Kafka offset data, which is sending data to their respective syncs. We also monitor to see if the traffic is receded or data consumption has increased or decreased unexpectedly. We will show how different stages of application states are controlled with the use of data and alerts, like disabling the app and enabling it according to the data. We also will show you how Priceline deals with brownouts, the gradual degradation of volumes by using machine learning over long periods, using different self healing techniques and custom apps. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Many Fortune 500 companies use Pivotal Cloud Foundry to push its high-quality code into production faster. While this helps companies enforce enterprise logging and application development standards, the traditional monitoring tools used to monitor development environments become the bottleneck because they are not architected to handle a firehose-nozzle connection. Learn how to use the new Splunk ITSI module for PCF, along with the new version of Splunk Firehose Nozzle for PCF to gain operational insight into PCF platform and increase developer satisfaction.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk Enterprise is powerful. Don&#x27;t cheat yourself of its power. When making decisions as to how to expand or standup Splunk’s footprint, you need to know what matters when making platform decisions. Considering compute, storage, virtualization, cloud infrastructure is a lot. There isn’t one place to review all the options you have. We will share the Splunk way to think of performance and how it relates to the underlying system resources. This means getting into the real nuts and bolts of performance. If you want to know how search affects indexing and what resources get consumed, this is the session to attend. If you also want to know how it affects what you purchase as a platform choice, this also is the session to attend. We also will review how partners have built architectures to simplify this process.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>If you’re not investing in new technology, you are going to be left behind! One of the key challenges within any state government agency is ensuring system and application performance, SLA enforcement, secure operations, and adhering to strict federal and state compliance mandates, all while operating with limited budgets and staff. With help from Splunk, Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies manage systems that issue public benefits to citizens, maintain child welfare, enforce child support, and monitor public health. Come to this session to learn how to leverage Splunk to help you understand the &quot;complete picture&quot; of your systems and business processes to help your team move toward proactive management and increase customer satisfaction within your governmental applications. Create something useful from millions and billons of lines of log data to improve your application!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>DATEV provides information services to ~2.5 million payrolling, accounting, and tax clients. Given the sensitivity of the personal and financial data that our clients process, DATAEV decided to establish a SOC to secure our clients&#x27; information, and we put Splunk at the core of its operations. In this session we will discuss four key elements relevant to building a successful SOC with Splunk. We&#x27;ll first discuss how we formed our SOC and orchestrated its activities internally. We&#x27;ll then discuss how we use MITRE&#x27;s ATT&amp;CK™ framework to prioritize activities, how we spread our SOC&#x27;s security knowledge to all relevant groups at DATEV, and how we use Splunk to create real-time situational awareness for different SOC customers, for stakeholders, and for management.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Winston Churchill once said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.&quot; Then again, Churchill wasn’t in cybersecurity...While our successes are certainly never final, our failures can absolutely be fatal—to a company and our continued employment. What&#x27;s a good way to actually measure success and failure, though, outside of not appearing on the front page of the paper? Well, as CrowdStrike notes, you have on average one minute to detect an attack in progress, ten minutes to understand it, and sixty minutes to contain it. We will show how to use this 1-10-60 Rule as a measuring metric and leverage the data and capabilities within Splunk and its ecosystem to ensure that we win the survival of the fastest.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Are you frustrated with the task of configuring syslog servers yourself to properly ingest data into Splunk? Take control of the syslog beast once and for all and point your &quot;514&quot; traffic to the new Splunk Connect for Syslog! This new Splunk-supported connector makes quick work of past struggles with syslog servers, sourcetyping, data enrichment, and scale. In this session we will dive into the configuration of the Splunk Connect for Syslog to properly filter, sourcetype, and format your data. We will demonstrate several out-of-the-box examples, highlighting new functionality such as HEC and Kafka transport for resiliency and scale, simple extensions for new device types, and data enrichment that extends far beyond simple sourcetyping of the raw message. Lastly, we will look forward to the integration of syslog with Splunk&#x27;s new Data Stream Processor, and highlight appropriate use cases for each solution. By the time we wrap up, you will know how to tame the syslog beast!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Teaching Splunk to Hear: Audio Spectrum Analysis in Splunk for Event Classification and Anomaly Detection</comments>
      <description>If we hear a nearby gunshot, we instinctively react. A mechanic often knows their machine&#x27;s sound so well that they can diagnose issues by sound alone. While machines can be given analytical capabilities with machine learning (ML), sensing human inputs - like auditory or other sensory data - in a form that machines can understand is challenging. In Splunk, we have been all about making machine data accessible to humans, but what if we flip that and make human data accessible to machines? I take audio captured from live and recorded sources and using Fast Fourier transform feed it into Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) for classification and anomaly detection. Can we use Splunk to detect gunshots? Can we learn a machine’s normal sounds to detect pending failures? This presentation uses Splunk to apply superhuman ML detection and learning capabilities to human data to show that the MLTK contains accessible tools you can apply to your IT and security problems. &lt;p/&gt;

If we hear a nearby gunshot, we instinctively react. A mechanic often knows their machine&#x27;s sound so well that they can diagnose issues by sound alone. While machines can be given analytical capabilities with machine learning (ML), sensing human inputs - like auditory or other sensory data - in a form that machines can understand is challenging. In Splunk, we have been all about making machine data accessible to humans, but what if we flip that and make human data accessible to machines? I take audio captured from live and recorded sources and using Fast Fourier transform feed it into Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) for classification and anomaly detection. Can we use Splunk to detect gunshots? Can we learn a machine’s normal sounds to detect pending failures? This presentation uses Splunk to apply superhuman ML detection and learning capabilities to human data to show that the MLTK contains accessible tools you can apply to your IT and security problems.

      <description>Splunk .conf is our favorite event every year and we wanted to extend the excitement while getting even more Splunky. So we grabbed an RV, set up some sensors, built an edge computing environment, and packed up the Big Data Beard recording equipment for a road-trip across the country for the week leading up to .conf, traveling from New York City to Las Vegas. We stopped along the way to hear awesome stories from fellow Splunk users, sharing them online via live chats and podcasts. With the power of Splunk, we captured data, discovered trends, predicted failures, and discovered more exciting ways to use Splunk to drive value from machine-generated data across the country. Hear the full story of how three engineers had the most interesting trip to .conf2019 of all!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Have you ever wondered what Joe meant when he referred to “Wire Data”? Today, you&#x27;ll see the applicability of wire data in your organization, and you&#x27;ll be amazed. Solve fraud, cybersecurity, ops, and business challenges, all with one single source of data. Wire data is the information that passes over computer and telecommunications networks to define communications between client and server devices. It is the result of decoding wire and transport protocols containing the bi-directional data payload. We will cover the use of wire data to solve security, IT operations, and business use cases, and see how the Splunk Stream platform is easily integrated into your existing data flows. The Splunk Essentials for Wire Data app from Splunkbase will be used to showcase dozens of examples using wire data to solve common business and technical issues. We will cover how to deploy and configure Splunk Stream in a distributed environment, including a demonstration.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>Have you ever wondered what Joe meant when he referred to “Wire Data”? Today, you&#x27;ll see the applicability of wire data in your organization, and you&#x27;ll be amazed. Solve fraud, cybersecurity, ops, and business challenges, all with one single source of data. Wire data is the information that passes over computer and telecommunications networks to define communications between client and server devices. It is the result of decoding wire and transport protocols containing the bi-directional data payload. We will cover the use of wire data to solve security, IT operations, and business use cases, and see how the Splunk Stream platform is easily integrated into your existing data flows. The Splunk Essentials for Wire Data app from Splunkbase will be used to showcase dozens of examples using wire data to solve common business and technical issues. We will cover how to deploy and configure Splunk Stream in a distributed environment, including a demonstration.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>The SOC of the Future</comments>
      <description>This presentation will discuss how Security Operation Centers (SOCs) will need to change to meet the cybersecurity challenges of the 2020s. The speaker will draw on his experience as a founder of the first SOC-as-a-Service company that delivers managed security services using Splunk. Most industry analysts envision that the next generation of SOCs will leverage AI, Big Data, and the Cloud, but how far can automation take us and is the concept of an autonomous SOC really practical? How will the SOC of the Future address the global shortage of cyber professionals? How will the role of security analysts need to change? Will the SOC of the Future still need to be housed in dedicated physical facilities? The speaker will provide a blueprint of Proficio’s vision of the SOC of the Future using Splunk and provide a playbook for IT leaders and aspiring IT leaders on how to drive continuous improvement in productivity and measurable outcomes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Tired of relying on static threshold-based alerts that don’t seem to provide much value? Do you typically end up finding outliers in your data by staring at lines on your dashboards? We are told machine learning is going make alerts and dashboards smarter, but how? We will help demystify machine learning and provide a practical guide to apply machine learning techniques for numeric outlier detection, and forecasting to make alerts and dashboards smarter and easier to use for actionable results. We will show you the basics of how you can understand your data, get them ready for machine learning, and get the machine to start working for you! You will leave the session beginning to think like a data scientist and knowing how to apply purpose-driven machine learning to your searches in Splunk! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Vectra customers and security researchers respond to some of the world’s most consequential threats. And they tell us that there’s a consistent set of questions they must answer when investigating any attack scenario.Yet, security data today is broken and unable to effectively answer those questions. It is either incomplete or storage and performance intensive.  Most teams don’t have the information necessary to properly answer the questions required to support their use cases; whether it be for threat hunting, investigations or supporting custom tools and models.In this session, hear about real-world use cases where security teams use machine learning engines to derive unique security attributes and how it is embedded into security workflows.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As a high-profile public-sector organization, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration deals with criminals claiming to be representatives of the organization and contacting the public with phishing e-mails every day. By using Splunk and RFC’s like, RFC7208 – Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, we have developed a technique to identify phishing attacks that are carried out under the disguise of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This technique is universally applicable. A precondition is access to the DNS logging. By means of this technique, insight can be obtained where the phishing e-mails are sent from and to whom the phishing e-mails are sent. In this talk we will start by explaining which standards are available to increase e-mail security and how we have build an app in Splunk, including dashboard and a wizard to create the necessary DNS records to gain insight information about the abuse of our domains.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As more technology organizations pursue agility and move towards continuous delivery, a stable and reliable IT infrastructure is the foundation that enables the transformation. However, the increasing complexity of the underlying infrastructure also brings a lot of challenges. Splunk has built a variety of solutions on top of our platform to deal with this complexity and deliver analytics and troubleshooting data to our engineering teams and decision makers. We will share a bit about our continuous integration process for triaging automated tests using Splunk, how we build IT infrastructure monitoring/analytics system based on Splunk ITSI, and how we take corresponding actions via VictorOps.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>We helped our client use Splunk to disrupt theft rings plaguing its retail stores. We&#x27;ll present how we took in public wifi data, tracked MAC addresses that appeared in multiple stores, and ultimately created a system in Splunk that alerted in-store loss prevention teams when individuals likely to be involved in theft rings entered the store. We&#x27;ll go over the steps taken to operationalize our theft deterrence program so that you can adopt it in your organization or modify it to fit your needs.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Why Dinosaurs Make Bad Pets: Legacy Monitoring Tools and their Extinction – TIAA Adopts ITSI as their new MoM</comments>
      <description>Too many tools, too many silos between data and collaboration, Outages take too long to Identify Root Cause and There is So Much Noise Abstract:  TIAA had a goal – to replace Legacy Monitoring with an AIOps approach.  What did that mean?  They had to find a better way to break down the silos between data and collaboration and start focusing attention on the right things with the right people.  Monitoring had become about MTTI (mean time to innocence) instead of fixing the fight issues more quickly and finding a way to move from ‘reacting’ to outages to ‘preventing’ them.  ITSI has become the ‘aggregator’ of monitoring data and will help TIAA move from the old Dinosaur Approach of being event driven to the AiOps approach of Service and Priority Driven.  Learn about the Journey, the Lessons Learned, and the Best Practices to Ensure Success.   &lt;p/&gt;
