      <comments>4 Easy Steps for Reclaiming Your Life (without quitting your job)</comments>
      <description>Everything breaks at 3:00 a.m. No one wants a team of engineers managing incidents on little to no sleep. Think about how tired you were the morning after the last all-nighter you pulled. Coffee can only do so much. If you work in any type of technical operations role you know how easy it is for on-call to take over your life. When managing an on-call team, you must think about the human side of on-call to avoid employee burnout and alert fatigue. In this session we will outline a four-step process to streamline incident management, review how to manage alerts through VictorOps, and give your team their lives back!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Production of crystal and gemstones requires high-class, top-quality output and unmatched quality and accuracy in the E2E production line. Based on in-depth experience, our joint client is one of the leading providers of production line machinery, serving its own business units as well as industry customers with precision optical instruments, grinding, sawing, drilling, and dressing tools. The new technical innovations in the area of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offer completely new options to improve smart production lines. Thus Accenture is partnering with Splunk on creating a roadmap to build a fully digital, smart factory that will become a world-leading lighthouse facility. This session will provide insights into how the power of data enabled by Splunk can realize a quantum step in modern production line environments. It also will help you understand the value of data science for predictive quality, digital twin scenarios, reduced lot size, and closed loop R&amp;D processes. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk/VictorOps allows your data to talk to people, and your people to talk to data, all while improving MTTR/MTTI. You’re already using Splunk today to get cool dashboards, ask questions of your data with search, and trigger important alerts based on data that’s of interest to you. But, just because alerts are important doesn’t mean they are for everyone. And for those who should respond to the alert, it’s important to get the alert into their hands immediately. Transitioning to a modern NOC, or “New Operations Center,” Splunk and VictorOps enable teams to collaboratively solve issues by providing on-call users with actionable alerts that allow for smarter investigation, faster mobilization, and lower mean time to resolution. In this session we’ll take a look under the hood at different Splunk and VictorOps integrations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How we understand your intent &gt; Splunk Natural Language Platform (NLP)</comments>
      <description>Understanding the intent of a natural language search is a major component of any natural language processing system. Although there are numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex problems in natural language processing, such as understanding intent also known as natural language understanding, very few of them discuss the challenges in production. In this session we take you on a journey from development to production of natural language understanding component of Splunk Natural Language Platform. We will discuss several engineering and data science challenges, and also provide holistic approaches to overcome those challenges. Attendees of the session should walk away with a deeper understanding of different state-of-the-art techniques, such as understanding the intent of a natural language search query, that can help them build their own applications in the natural language processing domain. &lt;p/&gt;

Understanding the intent of a natural language search is a major component of any natural language processing system. Although there are numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex problems in natural language processing, such as understanding intent also known as natural language understanding, very few of them discuss the challenges in production. In this session we take you on a journey from development to production of natural language understanding component of Splunk Natural Language Platform. We will discuss several engineering and data science challenges, and also provide holistic approaches to overcome those challenges. Attendees of the session should walk away with a deeper understanding of different state-of-the-art techniques, such as understanding the intent of a natural language search query, that can help them build their own applications in the natural language processing domain.

      <comments>Improving cost-efficiency of inland cargo shipping within the Port of Hamburg – powered by Splunk IoT capabilities</comments>
      <description>The Port of Hamburg is the main entrance to the German market and the third largest European port by transit volume, passing nearly 9 million containers each year. Although it has witnessed several stages of automation, there is still vast, untapped potential to preserve resources, both economic and ecological. By introducing IoT with Splunk, we move away from the docks and onto the vessels, equipping one tugboat and one inland cargo ship with IoT technology to measure movement and gather data about energy consumption from their 1950s diesel engines. The goal of this PoC environment is to automate the communication between ship and port authority, as well as visualize their field of operation to evenly distribute load and optimize the travel distances. On a broader spectrum, we also built a simulation model within our dashboard to investigate the benefits of adapting the vessels with engines powered to natural gas or electricity based on their consumption patterns.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Join us to learn how Lockheed Martin utilizes Splunk for IoT to bridge the gap between Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M), and how they took a multi-vendor, best-of-breed approach to solving their most critical O&amp;M challenges. If you attend this session you will see how real-time monitoring, and condition-based and predictive maintenance for critical assets can reduce unplanned downtime, improve maintenance activities, and increase operational efficiencies. We will also show how the Splunk implementation includes data convergence from disparate pieces of equipment and existing enterprise software solutions to create new insights and allow for actions that were once considered very difficult or too costly to realize.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>The digital convergence of IT and OT infrastructures promises huge efficiencies, cost savings and opportunities; but it is not without risk. OT was primarily built to run all types of manufacturing &amp; critical infrastructure processes while IT was built to store, transmit and manipulate data in order to conduct business. The two worlds could not be more different in purpose or design; and this can expose even the most secure organizations to new types of cyber threats. In this session we will discuss the current challenges we face in the drive to convergence and how to secure your industrial or critical infrastructure organization from the clear and present threat.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>AV and conference technology may seem trivial to the traditional IT OPS engineer, but it is one of the most visible and expensive parts of an enterprise. Everyone from the CEO to even the new hires on their first day use the technology. At PSE we were able to leverage Splunk to help us build, maintain, and manage our enterprise AV program (and save a lot of money in the process). In this session you will learn how we used Splunk to make data-driven decisions that influence and shape a multi-million dollar AV program.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>With around a million people interacting with the public transport in and around the city of Amsterdam daily, supplying accurate travel information is critical for an efficient and well-informed public transportation experience. With four different transport types (boat, bus, tram, and metro) and a host of custom systems creating around 4.5 million update events per day, analyzing this travel information depends on everything working seamlessly together. To provide accurate and trustworthy real-time passenger information services, monitoring of not only information availability but quality is needed. This use case shows how Splunk was implemented to monitor the data streams at all points in the information chain, and how real-time insights and alerting allows for proactive problem resolution and provides high-quality real-time information services for the end-user.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>With around a million people interacting with the public transport in and around the city of Amsterdam daily, supplying accurate travel information is critical for an efficient and well-informed public transportation experience. With four different transport types (boat, bus, tram, and metro) and a host of custom systems creating around 4.5 million update events per day, analyzing this travel information depends on everything working seamlessly together. To provide accurate and trustworthy real-time passenger information services, monitoring of not only information availability but quality is needed. This use case shows how Splunk was implemented to monitor the data streams at all points in the information chain, and how real-time insights and alerting allows for proactive problem resolution and provides high-quality real-time information services for the end-user.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Solar Analytics: Changing the World One Solar Panel At A Time</comments>
      <description>Solar generation and energy storage is dramatically dropping in cost and is being deployed on a massive scale across the globe. However, system monitoring and diagnostics, cost reporting, and usage can be difficult. With Splunk Essentials for ICS (Industrial Control Systems) and Splunk IAI (Industrial Asset Intelligence), a smart energy solution easily can be created. Does it seem too hard to onboard data? See how we use the Splunk add-on builder to create technology add-ons for solar panels and batteries. Want better visibility? Using Splunk IAI, we can gain faster insights into the performance of solar panels, inverters, and battery systems. Want to understand the economics? By applying business analytics, we can easily report of revenue, costs, and total return on investment. This solution can be applied to both small and large solar and energy storage installations, and we have a real world use case with some exciting energy data!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>DevOps adoption requires high performing teams. One of the biggest challenges organizations have when adopting a DevOps framework is how to get early wins, get value early in the process, and overcome plateaus in adoption. These improvements are typically achieved through the use of automation, improved responsiveness, better situational awareness, and increased sharing between teams. As you will see in this session, Splunk easily sits in the middle of all of this.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As one of the world&#x27;s largest and most trusted industrial brands, our customers demand the most technologically advanced and reliable systems to operate the most critical assets on the planet. Downtime for our customers is never an option. As we migrate our business delivery backbone to the cloud, we have to enforce the same level of reliability and performance on the architecture that supports our services - .9999 is failure where we live. In this presentation learn how ABB Digital and Splunk have collaborated to create new insights into the performance, security and operations of our Azure-backed ABB Digital IOT Platform to protect our brand and increase the velocity of services that we can bring to our internal customers and to those that invest in our ABB branded services.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk like your life depends on it</comments>
      <description>Many of the talks at .conf will be around how to solve business problems, how to configure clusters, and how to improve your KPIs. This talk focuses instead on how to monitor and detect problems in the physical realm: IoT. What do you do when an agency&#x27;s or business&#x27;s security posture is a matter of life and death? What are they doing to equip themselves against cyberattacks? This talk will discuss previous security breaches and industrial IoT device failures that result in death, and how they could have been detected or prevented with Splunk. It also will give you actionable takeaway&#x27;s for you to implement. After all, security isn&#x27;t always saving dollars; sometimes it is actually about saving lives.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>If you’re not investing in new technology, you are going to be left behind! One of the key challenges within any state government agency is ensuring system and application performance, SLA enforcement, secure operations, and adhering to strict federal and state compliance mandates, all while operating with limited budgets and staff. With help from Splunk, Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies manage systems that issue public benefits to citizens, maintain child welfare, enforce child support, and monitor public health. Come to this session to learn how to leverage Splunk to help you understand the &quot;complete picture&quot; of your systems and business processes to help your team move toward proactive management and increase customer satisfaction within your governmental applications. Create something useful from millions and billons of lines of log data to improve your application!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The most epic road trip to .Conf: IOT in an RV, OMG</comments>
      <description>Splunk .conf is our favorite event every year and we wanted to extend the excitement while getting even more Splunky. So we grabbed an RV, set up some sensors, built an edge computing environment, and packed up the Big Data Beard recording equipment for a road-trip across the country for the week leading up to .conf, traveling from New York City to Las Vegas. We stopped along the way to hear awesome stories from fellow Splunk users, sharing them online via live chats and podcasts. With the power of Splunk, we captured data, discovered trends, predicted failures, and discovered more exciting ways to use Splunk to drive value from machine-generated data across the country. Hear the full story of how three engineers had the most interesting trip to .conf2019 of all!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Threat Hunting in Industrial (ICS\OT) Environments</comments>
      <description>Industrial operations comprise a diverse blend of technology that run critical processes. The proliferation of automation and networking has increased the sophistication of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), also known as Operational Technology (OT) environments.Threats targeting OT are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. Dragos tracks 9 OT-targeting activity groups, the most significant of which, XENOTIME, was responsible for the TRISIS malware that targeted safety systems (SIS) resulting in multiple plant shutdowns and the potential to cause harm to human operators.Traditional IT threat hunting is not well-suited to OT environments. This session will outline the differences between IT and OT assessments, highlight the most significant threats facing OT, and review best practices for OT-specific threat hunting engagements, including techniques that empower defenders to detect and respond more efficiently to existing and future threats, therefore reducing adversary dwell time.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Unified Observability with OpenTelemetry</comments>
      <description>We now live in a Cloud Native world where we build and deploy software very differently from the previous generation. Large, centralized systems are being decoupled and distributed to address scalability needs and to allow companies to deliver value faster. Compared to monolithic applications, microservice architectures introduce complexity in network communication, feature much shorter life cycles, and require resiliency in dynamic environments. As companies began to build or migrate to microservice architectures they often run into operational complexity and struggle to efficiently monitor their environments. These challenges have highlighted the need to observe systems differently and lead to the rise of Observability. In this session, we will discuss OpenTelemetry and how it provides visibility into both distributed traces and metrics. We will walk through the architecture including client libraries and collection as well as cover key concepts including annotations, sampling policies and more. Live demos and coding examples will be presented through the talk. By the end of the session, you will know what OpenTelemetry is, why it is important, how you can get started and how you can get involved.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Splunk and its premium solution to accelerate DevOps lifecycle</comments>
      <description>As more technology organizations pursue agility and move towards continuous delivery, a stable and reliable IT infrastructure is the foundation that enables the transformation. However, the increasing complexity of the underlying infrastructure also brings a lot of challenges. Splunk has built a variety of solutions on top of our platform to deal with this complexity and deliver analytics and troubleshooting data to our engineering teams and decision makers. We will share a bit about our continuous integration process for triaging automated tests using Splunk, how we build IT infrastructure monitoring/analytics system based on Splunk ITSI, and how we take corresponding actions via VictorOps.&lt;p/&gt;
