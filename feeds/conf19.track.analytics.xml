      <comments>Business Flow vs The Real World. Cutting Through Complexity in Big Retail to Deliver Broad and Deep Assurance</comments>
      <description>At a major UK retail organization, we developed so many great dashboards over the years for every conceivable business area. This once sufficed, but it fuelled greater expectation in an ever harsher trading environment. Enter Peak Trade periods and the need for outcome-centered visibility across the order fulfillment process &quot;just got real&quot;.Could Splunk Business Flow help us to uncover the actual flow, given the teams who built it are long disbanded? Could we talk &quot;flow&quot; when support teams align to &quot;steps&quot;?  What we found was data that cannot agree what an Order is. Processes which tackle different aspects of an order, sometimes in parallel or batch. Processes which fork and then merge later on. Processes which go into planned deep-freeze for days or weeks before reawakening. Data formats which are hostile. The list goes on.We take you through the thought process, share mistakes and learnings, and outline considerations/techniques to help you win in the arena of real-world data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you want to monitor call-center employee performance in Splunk? We all know Splunk does a great job with web logs and IoT devices, but could it be used to provide a meaningful Scorecard for 3000+ employees and their management? We think it can, and we would like to share our successful implementation of a Splunk Employee Metrics Dashboard. Some of the concepts include: data preparation, summary indexes, tokens, custom CSS and JavaScript, drilldowns to the details, security, and more!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Classifying Evil – Combating Human Trafficking with the power of Data &amp; Analytics</comments>
      <description>Human trafficking is one of the most egregious and lucrative crimes of modern society. Traffickers use both lawful and illicit infrastructure to conduct business, making it difficult for defenders to identify trafficking on their services.In our next innovative leap, Global Emancipation Network partnered with Splunk4Good and Accenture to develop the world’s first trafficking content classifier. We are using a Splunk powered data &amp; analytics platform tocreate a risk scoring engine that assigns values to indicators and patterns and provides action options on flagged results to allow better decision-making for law enforcement, government, and private sector users. Learn how Splunk can turn data into robust classifiers to help save lives.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As organizations look to extend Splunk to new datasets for business process insights, it is crucial to have the right data to work with.

      <description>A large healthcare provider can process thousands of medical claims per day and millions of claims per month. The claims process involves multiple steps and many moving parts and can take weeks to complete. With the use of Splunk, a healthcare customer has been able to increase its visibility and insights into the medical claims process. The result is time savings in the claims process, improved customer experience, and increased productivity. Learn how a healthcare customer is leveraging Splunk to perform near real-time and historical analysis to continuously improve the claims process.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Introduction to monitoring business operations with Acceleris’ party dashboard</comments>
      <description>Why should running a business feel any different than throwing a party? To demonstrate how Splunk can be used to monitor and manage business operations, the DATA Mavericks team at Acceleris has iteratively perfected its Party Dashboard. It started out as a gimmick at the inauguration party of the company&#x27;s new headquarters, but now the Party Dashboard demonstrates how Splunk’s dashboarding helps any team get real-time visibility into any operation. Join this session to learn why they chose the relevant metrics, how they collected and fed the data to Splunk, and what meaningful insights were generated as a fun introductory example of using Splunk to get visibility into your business operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Just a normal day in the office – Data driven business process improvements for a global supply chain company.</comments>
      <description>“Our IT-powered business processes are too slow.” Does this sound familiar? If so, that is usually the perfect starting point to dig in and start improving them. Unfortunately, specific data that could help with that effort are not available – normally. In this session we will show you how we at Arvato Supply Chain Solutions got the data we needed and used it to improve the collaboration between IT and business. You will learn how we connected different IT systems such as SAP and conveyor line to Splunk Cloud, and how this helped us to analyze business processes with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI). And, as the icing on the cake, we give you a sneak peak of the machine learning algorithm we implemented to continuously improve our business processes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Machine Data Alchemy: Transforming Digital Exhaust into Campus Gold</comments>
      <description>Students, faculty and staff increasingly rely on technology for all aspects of campus activity. Universities must learn how to capture campus-wide data and transform it into value for everyone’s benefit. Clemson University will describe how they use data insights to deliver on student experience in a secure and connected setting. Clemson analyzed data from their Learning Management System (Canvas) using Splunk, so student and instructor activity is available in near real time which offers valuable feedback to the University. Learn how they drove additional speed and efficiency into other campus areas providing greater visibility of issues that consumed time and resources. Customer Support, IT security, and IT operations have also leveraged the Splunk platform to significantly expand and improve Clemson’s ability to make impactful decisions. We’ll share more details about these use cases so reserve your seat now for insights of your own!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Monitoring the order fulfilment process within an automated warehouse using Splunk Business Flow</comments>
      <description>Attendees will see how Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow are used to monitor the order fulfilment process within an automated warehouse in real time. You also will see how proactive alerts inform the warehouse that a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is under performing. Then, using process mining to investigate, find the root cause to solve issues before they become problems. This presentation will initially describe the workings of an automated warehouse and the data generated. It then will cover the process of ingesting this data into Splunk and configuring Splunk Business Flow to monitor processes and KPIs. Finally, the session will review the benefits to TGW and its customers from deploying Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow. Come to the session to see how the monitoring, alerting, and process mining functionality in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow provides a deep insight into what is happening inside an automated warehouse.&lt;p/&gt;
