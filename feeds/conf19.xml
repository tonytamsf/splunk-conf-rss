      <comments>4 Easy Steps for Reclaiming Your Life (without quitting your job)</comments>
      <description>Everything breaks at 3:00 a.m. No one wants a team of engineers managing incidents on little to no sleep. Think about how tired you were the morning after the last all-nighter you pulled. Coffee can only do so much. If you work in any type of technical operations role you know how easy it is for on-call to take over your life. When managing an on-call team, you must think about the human side of on-call to avoid employee burnout and alert fatigue. In this session we will outline a four-step process to streamline incident management, review how to manage alerts through VictorOps, and give your team their lives back!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>The sooner a support engineer understands your case and has sufficient information, the sooner your case will be resolved. Splunk Support engineers are vey good at what they do, but they can&#x27;t read minds, and they can&#x27;t see into your computers. How can you make them understand your issue better and faster? What steps can you take ahead of submitting a support case that will ensure that you understand your issue as well? Attendees will receive some important tips resulting in a faster TTR.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Accelerate your ability to sniff out application exceptions and detect outliers in performance KPIs</comments>
      <description>Are you frustrated with how long a Splunk time series query of your data can take when you need it now, and are you looking to use machine learning to quickly gain insights about your app’s performance? Finding application exceptions or detecting outliers in your performance KPIs too late can lead your business to suffer without the information it needs to make the right decisions in a timely manner. We will show you how we used the metrics index and machine learning capabilities in Splunk to make better alerts, build scheduled performance reports, and ultimately gain deeper insights and make better decisions based on our data. Sharing these insights as a weekly scheduled report helped our team find hidden issues, increase performance awareness, and maintain SLAs around performance KPIs. Additionally, better alerts operationally helped us to detect outliers in performance metrics within minutes after they occur. Join this session to see queries, demos and several examples for you to take back with you and implement this solution at your company. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Agent Based Modeling for CryptoFinance in Splunk</comments>
      <description>Cryptocurrency ecosystems are highly complex, distributed, and rapidly evolving, rendering many existing financial models ineffective. By aggregating the heterogeneous data streams that are produced by distinct groups within crypto (blockchains, mining pools, exchanges, etc.), we have built a unified analytical platform called Nakamoto Terminal (NTerminal) using Splunk. By leveraging NTerminal, we are creating an adapted agent-based modeling (ABM) system; agents monitor the state of the ecosystem by consuming real time updates from the individual data sources that modulate their state and connectivity. Different heuristic models are called upon to facilitate data transformations and agent interactions. Within this ecosystem, collective agent activity reveals emergent properties and patterns of behavior. With Splunk as the centerpiece, integrated reports, dashboards, or searches allow you to better navigate the ecosystem of interest.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>A healthcare company changing lives with Splunk</comments>
      <description>This session is about a healthcare company born from cybersecurity using Splunk to disrupt the traditional healthcare delivery model. Accuhealth has created a remote patient monitoring platform to analyze health and biometric data collected from IoT devices to improve the patients&#x27; quality of life. A doctor is alerted in real-time of any abnormal changes to their patient&#x27;s vitals and have immediate access to medical trends, allowing the doctor to make faster and more informed decisions. Splunk is at the nerve center of our platform. Using machine learning and health data, the tool provides actionable insights and predictive analysis to patients, doctors, caregivers, and researchers. Additionally, we have leveraged Splunk to integrate the three pillars of telehealth: Telemedicine, Chronic Care Management, and Remote Patient Monitoring. Learn first hand and see a demo of how Accuhealth is creating a paradigm shift in healthcare. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Analyzing and Visualizing Streaming Telemetry Data with Splunk</comments>
      <description>Streaming telemetry is a new approach supported by major networking companies such as Cisco,  as well as service providers. It provides better real time data of routing/switching devices without the performance impact that comes with SNMP. Network operators who turn to streaming telemetry often have sophisticated goals in mind and are not simply looking to collect data and throw it onto a graph. Instead, they are looking at advanced use cases where further processing is performed on the data (e.g., analytics or machine learning) and intelligent action is triggered based on this analysis. This presentation. will discuss how to get telemetry data into Splunk to search, analyze, visualize, and create alerts including examples from an existing deployment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>A Timely Development: I Built a Splunk App To Save Security Analysts Time - And So Can You!</comments>
      <description>Have you ever had an idea that would improve incident response? I did. I knew I could save security analysts time by providing a tool that enabled analysts to determine if an endpoint had persistent malware present in seconds. However, it would need to integrate seamlessly into their incident response workflow and have a quality user interface. Frankly, that felt like an insurmountable hurdle for someone with little front-end development experience. I was pleasantly surprised to find that even as a solo developer, I was able to create a full-featured Splunk App with an interface that looks like it was designed by someone far more talented. Through a demonstration of my incident response app and a discussion of my experience building it, I’ll show you how Splunk makes it easier and, more importantly, realistic to bring your own ideas to life. I’ll also share a few pain-points I encountered so you can avoid some of the mistakes I made.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Would you be able to detect a sophisticated adversary targeting your Kubernetes clusters and workloads tonight? How do busy teams with stacked backlogs find time to learn how to attack Kubernetes clusters, detect those attacks, and build defenses to reduce the attack surface? We will demonstrate an effective purple team methodology that &quot;uses every part of the buffalo&quot; by 1) executing attacks on Kubernetes using the open source tool Peirates, 2) tracking the attack artifacts from the adversary simulation in Splunk, 3) teaching the defenders how the attack was performed and where to look for forensic artifacts, and 4) working together in the purple-est way possible to improve detection and response capabilities using Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Peirates.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you love the idea of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, but you’re not sure how to use it in your Splunk-centric security program? This talk will teach you practical ways to use the framework in your own organization and the Splunk security tools that will help you do so. We&#x27;ll start the talk by identifying an adversary and some of their known techniques, and then we&#x27;ll show how to choose an appropriate set of detections and how to test whether those detections are working as expected. You&#x27;ll leave the talk better able to take advantage of threat intelligence, cover the right set of ATT&amp;CK™ tactics and adversary groups, and eliminate organizational blind spots.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you want to use machine learning to enhance your datacenter security monitoring, but you don’t know where to start? Then this is the talk for you. Come learn how high secure datacenter operations benefit from operationalizing machine learning. With the help of the Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit, your security analysts can take different approaches to use case creation and gain new insight into what&#x27;s going on in your environment. We&#x27;ll detail the challenges, benefits and use cases of using machine learning for datacenter security monitoring, and we&#x27;ll answer questions such as: Where does it make sense to apply machine learning, and where should we stick with classic searches? Can we detect meaningful anomalies in system behavior? Is it possible to cluster our account activities and find unusual patterns? This is a practical session of security monitoring use cases, deep diving into the ideas, concepts and the SPL behind them.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Alerts in cloud environments require your team to quickly and precisely gather evidence and isolate affected environments. The GE Digital Predix Incident Response (IR) team found an abundance of content for analyzing forensic evidence from Windows environments, but they noticed a gap in content built for performing investigations on Linux-based hosts. The Predix IR team will discuss the tools they have built to contain a compromised Linux-based hosts, gather evidence, and analyze that evidence in Splunk. Utilizing splunk searches, lookups, and visualization components to look both narrowly into the data set as well as broadly across the rest of the environmental data in splunk to identify known bad or potentially suspicious activities that may warrant further investigation by an analyst. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>We developed an automation framework that classifies and mitigates emails reported to the SOC. The framework acts as an engine that consumes multiple data sources, including a supervised machine learning model and a risk scoring algorithm to assess with high confidence if an email is phishing, spam, or benign. We will discuss the benefits of our approach to phishing mitigation, such as enhancing our SOC&#x27;s ability to automatically identify, prioritize, and mitigate malicious phishing attempts against employees before any damage is done.  The session will outline the overall design of the framework, detail the primary components that are used within Splunk Phantom and Splunk Enterprise Security, and will outline the supervised machine learning model that we trained to aide the automation engine.  &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Auto-Monitoring of search workloads with Workload Management</comments>
      <description>How do you ensure that business-critical searches are not impacted by non-critical searches? How do you divvy up Splunk search capacity among internal teams? How do you assign appropriate resources for ingestion and search? Do you want to monitor runaway/rogue searches in real time and prevent adverse impact on the rest of your users? If you are struggling with these questions, this is the session for you! Splunk Workload Management puts you in control. It allows you to define resource pools, access to them, limit the maximum number of concurrent searches in a pool, and monitor rogue searches. Using Linux cgroups to allocate CPU and memory to different pools, Workload Management allows you to create separate pools for ingestion and search. You can create sub-pools within search to isolate incoming searches. The rules can be defined based on search type, user, roles, application etc. Even better, you can monitor for rogue searches and automatically abort or throttle them.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Beyond Tier 1 Automation: The Hidden Value of Splunk Phantom Automation for Security Operations </comments>
      <description>You&#x27;ve probably heard examples of Splunk Phantom automating 90% of Tier 1 processes, but did you know that Phantom improves human-lead processes too? Come learn about the hidden value of validation and utility playbooks from Penn State University’s Enterprise Security Manager and Splunk’s Lead Technologist for Higher Education. Validation playbooks are automated tests run to validate a human judgement or request. Utility playbooks are short easy-to-create playbooks in Phantom that an analyst  runs during an investigation.  We’ll cover when to use validation and utility playbooks, how to get started creating them, and ideas for other playbooks you can use to improve your daily operations. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Last year, at the Container Strikes Back session, Brent Boe and Brian Bingham introduced the new Splunk official container. Today, we’re talking about the benefits as well as the challenges we encountered adopting the “Splunk in containers!” strategy at the Ministry of Defence for both our testing and our production environments. Our small DevOps team tasked with deploying Splunk did not have the bandwidth to build a resilient and scalable Splunk deployment in a traditional way at the pace required. By consuming the official Splunk Docker image, taking advantage of SmartStore backed by AWS S3, making a liberal use of other AWS services, and with support from Splunk PS architects as well as communities around Splunk’s official GitHub repos, we were able to rapidly deploy a complex Splunk cluster in AWS with minimal overhead. This has allowed our project to keep to our tight deadlines around cloud migration, while also providing a monitoring platform that can be scaled out over time as adoption increases.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As organizations shift away from legacy Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) approaches towards an integrated risk management (IRM) strategy, cyber risk management paradigms must also shift. This presentation will address why firms are shifting to IRM and how the shift to IRM will affect security organizations globally. We will showcase strategies used by forward-leaning peers and thought leaders to operationalize integrated risk management programs in their organizations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>The boss saw Ironman and wanted to create a JARVIS-like assistant for our SOC...so we built him one using Splunk. In this session we will share how we developed a Splunk virtual assistant to improve SOC efficiency and support the SOC 2.0 model of continual improvement. SOC JARVIS solves problems such as: How does a SOC manage its attack detection ideas and knowledge? How does an analyst understand the impact of their search changes on alert volumes? How does the SOC manage feedback between analysts and search authors? Learn how to use Splunk in a novel way to address these problems so that you can make your SOC workflows more efficient and let analysts spend more time threat hunting and improving how they detect attacks.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Build Automated Decisions for Incident Response with Splunk Phantom</comments>
      <description>Incident response (IR) analysts are required to make multiple decisions on every alert and incident. Whether the decision is to escalate, respond, or to discard the alert, each one of those decisions is critical to protecting their environment. With the integration of SOAR platforms like Splunk Phantom into IR teams, many of those decisions can now be automated for analysts. These decisions can save hours of work for analysts and allow for focus on more critical alerts. However, there are still questions to answer before implementing these decisions. What data is needed to make confident decisions? Where in the process should these decisions be made? How can existing decisions be improved? How should new decisions be integrated? The General Electric IR team has worked to answer these questions by using Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Phantom. In this session, we will show how our team approached these questions, implemented solutions, and integrated decisions for our analysts to save time and focus their efforts.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Advanced attackers that live off your land add insult to what can be very serious injury. In this session we&#x27;ll show you how to use behavioral analysis to identify advanced attackers that evade traditional signature-based detection methods. We do so in our organization by using Splunk to combine insights from traditional data sources to detect activity across multiple phases of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework. We&#x27;ll focus on how to build queries  tune them for your environment, and start catching these threat actors with behavioral detections as soon as you get back from .conf.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Building threat-driven use cases for the real world with iDefense intelligence</comments>
      <description>Where did you come up with the idea for your last use case? Traditional approaches to use case ideation focus on identifying new use cases based on the data already available to the security operations center. However, the threat landscape is constantly changing, and attackers are constantly getting more sophisticated. To detect these advanced threats, our use cases must be based on both business and threat context. In this session, we will share our approach to building innovative use cases based on real-world threats. Starting with industry-specific threat intelligence, we identify the threat actors and their specific tactics, techniques, and procedures. With these insights, we identify use cases relevant to the business, map them to both existing and new data sources, and prioritize implementation based on the specific threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>At a major UK retail organization, we developed so many great dashboards over the years for every conceivable business area. This once sufficed, but it fuelled greater expectation in an ever harsher trading environment. Enter Peak Trade periods and the need for outcome-centered visibility across the order fulfillment process &quot;just got real&quot;.Could Splunk Business Flow help us to uncover the actual flow, given the teams who built it are long disbanded? Could we talk &quot;flow&quot; when support teams align to &quot;steps&quot;?  What we found was data that cannot agree what an Order is. Processes which tackle different aspects of an order, sometimes in parallel or batch. Processes which fork and then merge later on. Processes which go into planned deep-freeze for days or weeks before reawakening. Data formats which are hostile. The list goes on.We take you through the thought process, share mistakes and learnings, and outline considerations/techniques to help you win in the arena of real-world data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In this session, we tackle data breaches and information exfiltration from cloud file stores. Beyond the attacks that make headlines and result in millions of stolen personal records, we will also focus on the far less publicized risks related to exposure of intellectual property, infrastructure details or finances. We will share our experience in building a defensive strategy that now detects highly-covert exfiltration attempts.To this end, we first shed a lot of light on how companies use general-purpose file stores, such as Box, Office365 or Google Drive. We cover the types of files that commonly get stored in the cloud, file sharing practices, access properties, as well as uses of cloud stores by various departments. There are a lot of unexpected insights which eventually invalidate common security assumptions.As the boundary between good and bad gets blurred, we will provide you with a peek into how to design an effective data-driven defense. This approach helped us hone our detection to just tens of validly suspicious exfiltration files in a massive cloud store.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Human trafficking is one of the most egregious and lucrative crimes of modern society. Traffickers use both lawful and illicit infrastructure to conduct business, making it difficult for defenders to identify trafficking on their services.In our next innovative leap, Global Emancipation Network partnered with Splunk4Good and Accenture to develop the world’s first trafficking content classifier. We are using a Splunk powered data &amp; analytics platform tocreate a risk scoring engine that assigns values to indicators and patterns and provides action options on flagged results to allow better decision-making for law enforcement, government, and private sector users.

      <comments>ControlWatch: Cybersecurity Monitoring for Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control System (ICS) Environments</comments>
      <description>Today’s industrial, manufacturing, and building management systems rely on an array of on-demand, uninterruptable technologies, like Industrial Control Systems (ICS), for their day-to-day operations. Escalations in cyber-related attacks have made increased visibility into these often overlooked systems paramount. Over the past year, Booz Allen has built an OT cybersecurity monitoring solution called ControlWatch that provides enhanced visibility and anomaly detection with a focus on OT environments. By aggregating data from within and around the process, the solution provides a critical view for plant managers, C-level decision-makers, or the boots on the ground. We’ll highlight the context into, detection of, and alerting on a myriad of malicious and misaligned activities. We have implemented unique OT-centric use cases and will walk-through a day-in-the-life scenario to show you how the solution increases cybersecurity awareness and resilience in a production organization at all levels.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>&quot;Did we just lose ALL our knowledge objects? Do you know how much time and energy that was?&quot; After a destructive resync, Paychex lost two months of its knowledge object creations/modifications. We learned to be prepared if it were to ever happen again. How? It&#x27;s easier than you might think, and you don&#x27;t have to be an admin. You’ll learn how to proactively save your work (dashboards, reports, data models, MLTK experiments, ITSI glass tables, macros, views, etc.) and audit changes when they occur. You will leave the session knowing how to manage the ever-increasing amount of things you create. You&#x27;ll also have solutions that can save you time and effort from having to recreate lost/modified objects, including how to restore service faster. You also will come away with peace of mind knowing that you can take control of safeguarding and protecting your work, thereby covering your assets when a disaster happens.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Fabric Search(DFS) - Under the Hood</comments>
      <description>Data Fabric Search (DFS) is the next generation of Splunk’s search platform. DFS executes the following vision: Splunk should be able to leverage compute assets from anywhere and access and execute on data regardless of type and origin. Inspired by the above mantra DFS scales Splunk searches both in terms of volume and cardinality. In this session you will learn how DFS searches scale to trillion scale event volume or billion scale cardinality - capabilities previously impossible. DFS is not limited to local but by supporting scaled federated executions also powers remote splunk deployments. The Search Pipeline of DFS has been build grounds up based on lambda architecture which provides massive scale, high throughput and performance gains. At the end some of the performance and scale numbers which has been achieved internally will be shared.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Fabric Search: Opening doors to unprecedented levels of scale and performance</comments>
      <description>Data Fabric Search (DFS) is one of Splunk&#x27;s newest technologies built to handle the ever increasing rate of growth in data. Combining the rich functionality of Splunk with the parallel execution of Spark, DFS enables searching data at scales previously unheard of. This session will be decidedly for a technical audience as we deep-dive into DFS architecture and demonstrate the capabilities DFS offers to execute searches that scan more than one trillion events at a time. We will also share our experience as performance engineers with tips and tricks on how to tune Splunk deployments to take full advantage of this exciting new feature. Having additional capability to search at massive scale opens doors to use cases that no longer need to make the trade-off between depth of analysis and timeliness of results. Come learn more about Data Fabric Search and see real-world examples of its power put to use. The impossible is possible.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>See Data Fabric Search (DFS) in action! We will walk through real-world customer stories and demonstrate how DFS was used to make effective business decisions. With DFS, organizations can quickly weave together insights across the enterprise to get a deeper and more comprehensive view of customer behavior, organizational threats, or business opportunities. Data Fabric Search excels in speed and scale with use cases primarily falling into two categories: 1) High performance and high cardinality searches processing large volumes of data, and 2) Queries that run operations across multiple deployments. For each customer story, we will demonstrate how DFS is able to run these queries successfully and show how they created powerful business results.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you have complex or obscure data?  Do users, without the necessary domain knowledge, struggle to work with this data?  Perhaps a Data Model can help bridge the knowledge gap.  This session will use valuable (but complex…and even scary) mainframe metrics as a working example of how to get users up and running fast by leveraging the power of a data model.  But, these principles are not just for mainframe.  They can equally apply to other data types and scenarios.  Not all users are well-versed in complex data structures and fields, but some are…so combine Subject Matter Expert (SME) knowledge with this great Splunk facility to make everyone’s life simpler.  Deliver real results in a very short time with little overhead or burden on users.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>How do I get data into Splunk? What is a sourcetype? Does Splunk already know how to handle my data? What app do I use? What if all my data is syslog? If you are asking these questions, then this session is for you. After all, data quality is the foundation of becoming a data-driven organization. This session will walk through onboarding fundamentals. We will discuss the importance of a timestamp and what to do if your data may not have one. We will explain when to use an existing or create a new sourcetype. We will review the process of examining an app from Splunkbase and determining what sourcetype the app expects. By the end of this session you will no longer use syslog as a sourcetype, but as a means of collecting data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Stream Processor: Architecture and SDKs</comments>
      <description>Popular stream processing frameworks (such as Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and Apache Kafka Streams) make stream processing accessible to developers with language bindings typically in Java, Scala, and Python. These frameworks also include some variant of streaming SQL support to further expand the accessibility of large-scale, low-latency, high-throughput stream processing. What&#x27;s missing is bringing the world of stream processing to the Business Intelligence user. At Splunk we&#x27;ve built a tool called Splunk Data Stream Processor (DSP) to fill this gap.  In this session, Max and Sharon will present the design and architecture of DSP. We will compare it with other stream processing frameworks to show you how DSP allows users to visually author and preview stream processing pipelines and instantly deploy them at scale. We will also present our developer SDKs, allowing third-party custom functions to be developed and integrated for data processing. With its high level abstractions for business users and extensible framework for developers, Data Stream Processor makes stream processing accessible to the widest possible audience.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Stream Processor: How to get the most out of your data!​</comments>
      <description>Have you ever been asked to create a resilient petabyte scale data collection and distribution architecture? Do you need to transform data before it is indexed to remove unnecessary or sensitive data or even enrich the data with a lookup before writing the data to your index? Do you need to detect specific patterns to identify the event line break, event timestamp, or assign the appropriate sourcetype? Do you need to control where to send the data including the specific Splunk Index(es) or even a non-Splunk Sink?If so, we will show you how Splunk’s Data Stream Processor (DSP) can be used to address these requirements to meet both current and future demands. We will walk through the scenarios that customers are dealing with today for these requirements. Finally we will talk about how Universal Forwarder, Heavy Weight Forwarder, and HTTP Event Collector fit into this new data ingestion architecture.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Deep Dive: How to use Splunk to protect the environment</comments>
      <description>Can Splunk help eliminate environmental risks and save the company money at the same time? The Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) sets standards defining the amount of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that can be safely released. Honda Manufacturing of Alabama (HMA) must adhere to those standards and track our compliance within the parameters set forth by the ADEM. Failure to comply with these standards will result in potentially damaging the environment and large fines. HMA uses a Regenerative Thermal Oven (RTO) to burn off pollutants from our paint department, which is controlled by an Allen Bradley Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Using this PLC and the sensors built into the RTO, we collect individual chamber temperatures, fan speeds, exhaust temperatures, motor winding temperatures, motor vibrations, and fan vibrations. Using these readings and the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit we try to predict if the temperature will be within the set range. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Deep Dive on The New Dashboarding &amp; Content Export Experience</comments>
      <description>This session provides detailed guidance on how to use the new dashboard framework into Splunk apps. It first goes over the basic get started tutorial, which helps developers to build a dashboard in just a few minutes. Then it dives deep into the overall architecture, technology stacks, and individual components that can be customized, including layouts, visualizations, data sources, inputs, event handlers. By attending this session, Splunk app developers will be able to integrate dashboards into the apps flexibly and reliably. This session will also walk through the best practices that can help developers to build the optimal dashboards. This session is targeted to both new Splunk app developers and existing Splunk app developers. For people who already know about the existing Splunk technology stack such as Backbone, SimpleXML, SplunkJS, this session will also go through how to migrate to the new framework. As a bonus, this session will also talk about how to export dashboards as beautiful images and PDFs that 100% matches the original ones! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Machine Learning on the stream is useful for a few important reasons: scenarios where we want to dramatically reduce the resource utilization while providing high fidelity results and in use cases where we need algorithms to adapt to changing patterns and drifts in distributions real time.In this talk, we will discuss ongoing work in the area of streaming machine learning and show how we leverage Flink and DSP to build real time machine learning systems that allow us to perform adaptive thresholding and anomaly detection online.As an application of these principles, we will showcase how real time machine learning is used to detect anomalies in DSP pipelines.The talk will introduce relevant background in streaming machine learning as well as the problem of anomaly detection on Kubernetes logs.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Have you ever been positive you had found evil, only to realize it was normal after hours of triage and work? We have all heard and love “KNOW NORMAL FIND EVIL,” but how hard is it to actually know normal? The MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework gives defenders a better map to “find evil,” but how can this framework be used to “know normal”?Rick will discuss how knowing normal in a world of abnormal is harder than one thinks, and how addressing the actual root cause of evil can improve the technology industry as a whole.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Distributed Tracing via Structured Logging Using Splunk</comments>
      <description>Is your team spending too much time investigating common business and engineering questions due to a lack of transparency into your rapidly growing distributed system? Is logging for your microservices a haphazard mess? Is isolating a single event workflow throughout the pipeline just TOO MUCH WORK? Learn how we utilized Splunk to simplify troubleshooting distributed systems at Bloomberg. In this session, we will: Walk through some custom components that provide transparency into complex distributed microservices; show how to utilize them to find and isolate a single event workflow; explain how to write highly-optimized Splunk SPL queries to answer various business workflow questions; and demonstrate how to present the results using advanced visualizations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Wouldn’t it be a great if we had Splunk’s version of Moneyball; an application where everyone comes out ahead by leveraging data to drive effective Splunk enablement and adoption? Splunk’s internal logs have a wealth of information about how Splunk is being used within your organization. Let’s take drinking the “Splunk Champagne” to the next level by applying statistics and machine learning to Splunk’s internal logs! This session will cover segmenting users based on their search profiles - number of searches run, average response times, and recency of searches executed, among other criteria. We’ll use techniques such as clustering to classify users from novice to experts, and use TF-IDF and text analytics techniques to understand commands used in search strings. Enriching this data with completed and planned Splunk Education courses, lunch &amp; learn sessions, and other training activities will enable your users to achieve the Splunk Ninja status they’re looking for! &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Driving Adoption of Splunk in Your Enterprise</comments>
      <description>So, you have Splunk in your enterprise but people aren&#x27;t using it. What do you do? After working with many organizations in financial services, we have heard the response &quot;yes, we use Splunk.&quot; However, there is a large gap between the organizations that have a Splunk license and those that are truly using Splunk. What is the key to successful adoption of Splunk as an enterprise tool? In this session hear how FIS has driven an uptake\in Splunk adoption across multiple business lines and external clients. Using Splunk, FIS have supported off-prescription solutions including system parameter inquiry, operator fraud, financial invoicing, client conference data analytics, staff resource allocations, and status reporting.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Failure to log everything needed for maximum visibility in your environment can leave huge gaps in your ability to remediate threats. But running an enterprise-level logging program can be difficult: how do you know if you&#x27;re logging everything necessary to detect threats? Are all of your technologies configured to send the right logs? Are they all logging to Splunk? In this session we will help you answer these and other critical questions of your logging program, which will ultimately help you remediate issues and better use log analysis to mitigate threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Effective Strategies for Monitoring Docker and Kubernetes Environments</comments>
      <description>Containerization and the adoption of microservices have dramatically accelerated software innovation. However, containerized environments behave so differently compared to traditional ones that they present new observability challenges, and require new monitoring strategies and tools. What are those challenges? In this talk, we will discuss three – the explosion in scale, massive component churn caused by continuous delivery, and the need for infrastructure-to-application correlation –  then share effective strategies for overcoming them in a number of practical examples.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Empathy: The Forgotten Data Point</comments>
      <description>For those of us who work in the technology sector and adjacent disciplines, our technical skills are largely seen as our most valuable; the programming languages we know, what we’ve accomplished with those languages and so on. While our technical skills are usually our ticket in, they have little or no impact on how happy we are at work. For example, the correlation between your proficiency in Splunk and your commitment to your team is negligible. As life at work evolves, we see the rising need for an alternative data point: empathy. With the help of sentiment analysis, our talk will highlight how the presence or absence of empathy impacts our working lives. And, better yet, how we can change the course of a team, project, and our own perception by leveraging empathy in a conscious way.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Enhanced Anomaly Detection: Join T-Mobile and Splunk as we Deep Dive an Enterprise-IT Operational Use Case</comments>
      <description>Is confidence in your ability to disassociate real alerts from noise at an all-time low? Are alerts becoming ineffective because they’re excessive? Many organizations across many industries wrestle with these questions daily. Even so, the prevalence of alert noise persists. Join us to understand how T-Mobile is using Splunk Enterprise with the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit to identify and narrow the point of origin of service-impacting events across our suite of enterprise applications. Using the DensityFunction algorithm to highlight anomalous behavior, we’re able to focus an investigation on a small subset of the applications which in turn leads to faster resolution of the issues we’re confronted with. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Enhancing Diversity in Tech through Employee Resource Groups - Our BEAMs Journey</comments>
      <description>Splunk’s support and promotion of diversity and inclusion led to the establishment of their most recent Employee Resource Group (ERG) for black employees called BEAMS. Black Employees and Mentors, BEAMS, officially launched February 2019, and has provided a platform for underrepresented employees to make an impact within the Splunk community and beyond. Join members of BEAMS for this discussion about changing the narrative for Black employees in the tech industry, and learn how you can thoughtfully provoke the same within your organization. Come learn from the experiences of BEAMS and their open and bold mindset, how BEAMS navigates challenges associated with creating change, promoting equality within a large organization, and going beyond the office walls, and how they support partnerships with youth education organizations. Be prepared to leave with thoughtful anecdotes and an action item list for your organization.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Every Minute Counts: Integrating Splunk and VictorOps to Accelerate Incident Response</comments>
      <description>Splunk/VictorOps allows your data to talk to people, and your people to talk to data, all while improving MTTR/MTTI. You’re already using Splunk today to get cool dashboards, ask questions of your data with search, and trigger important alerts based on data that’s of interest to you. But, just because alerts are important doesn’t mean they are for everyone. And for those who should respond to the alert, it’s important to get the alert into their hands immediately. Transitioning to a modern NOC, or “New Operations Center,” Splunk and VictorOps enable teams to collaboratively solve issues by providing on-call users with actionable alerts that allow for smarter investigation, faster mobilization, and lower mean time to resolution. In this session we’ll take a look under the hood at different Splunk and VictorOps integrations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you remember the time when you had to attend lectures in person? Monash University has extended teaching hours and stopped repeating lectures. To provide flexibility to students and release pressure on finite campus facilities, lectures are now live streamed and are guaranteed to cover 100% of the classroom content. We are using Splunk and IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) to help monitor live streaming of lectures. It is impossible to manually monitor hundreds of teaching spaces in real-time and keep track of lecture schedules, the status of AV devices, microphones, and audio signals. Come and see how we at Monash University use Splunk ITSI glass tables to rule them all! Using ITSI we get real-time insights into service health and entity-level alerting based on ITSI thresholds.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>It’s a bird, it’s a plane. Yes, it’s a plane! Let’s go for a flight into the skies of aviation data and the concepts and tools that make aviation data analytics easy. I’ve been capturing this open data for nearly two years, and I’ve been able to unravel some insights based on four projects. Two projects focus on processing Canadian/U.S. safety reports, while the other two are processing data captured and logged from a radio receiver made from a Raspberry Pi. Data Science is offering very exciting careers and providing an important competitive differentiator, which is why we’ll be reviewing several statistical processing techniques made possible by the power of the Machine Learning Toolkit. We also will cover exploratory data analysis tools built into the Search Processing Language. Before we approach for landing, we’ll show everything under the hood so that everybody can understand the things that make it fly. This is both a technical deep dive as-well-as a practical usage walkthrough.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>This session will highlight a new strategy for fast and effective replication of knowledge bundles, resulting in up-to-date search results and a significant reduction in WAN bandwidth usage. Knowledge bundles include the knowledge objects that a search-head distributes to search peers so that they can process a distributed search. Replication of these bundles to search peers can be slow for large deployments and also consumes significant WAN bandwidth, especially in multi-site deployments. This new replication option in Splunk Enterprise accelerates search access to recent data and reduces WAN bandwidth consumption.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Going beyond basic perimeter defense, Threat Hunting cuts through the noise of endpoint telemetry and anti-virus data to find nation-state level Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) that hide below the alert threshold. We will demonstrate, through 4 hunt analytic use cases, how to overcome the legacy challenge of relying on Packet Capture (PCAP) data to detect adversaries, highlighting the need to transform Hunt operations by combining Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry data with knowledge of APT behavior to find hidden adversaries. This talk will provide a framework for planning and executing hunts, demonstrate why focusing on EDR telemetry data can add additional value over and beyond traditional network data, and how to strengthen hunting through a Purple Team approach.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>At Mastercard, we assist our banks in making sure their cardholders are protected from fraud attacks on their cards. We process tens of thousands of transactions per second all within tens of milliseconds. When our platform has outages (big and little), we need to understand how the problem occurred so we can prevent future issues and provide the best service possible. I will provide a detailed use case of a past incident, our challenges and how Splunk helped us find the culprit and make changes to our platform and processes to prevent the issue in the future.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Finding Evil Is Never An Accident: How to Hunt in BOTS</comments>
      <description>To secure the modern endpoint, you need sufficient data, the right visibility and analysis, and the technology necesary to stop an intrusion. We will leverage BOTSv4 data in this session to help you test and validate Splunk use cases related to hunting threats using endpoint data. We’ll cover several real world case studies as described in MITRE ATT&amp;CK™, and we will simulate adversary groups by executing a single Atomic test and building an elaborate chain reaction. We will then show you in Splunk how to confirm your data quality and confirm you have what you need to detect and evict an adversary from your environment. We will demonstrate practical hunt techniques using BOTSv4 data and how to raise the flag when data is missing or is not required.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Fiserv Turns ITSI Up to 11 – with Powerful KPIs, Better Performance, &amp; Custom Alerts</comments>
      <description>ITSI provides a platform to turn your never-ending stream of app and infrastructure data into manageable KPIs that you can act on, but how do you manage the number of events ITSI detects? What if you need to extend ITSI with additional capabilities in order to merge your alerts with your support team&#x27;s response processes? We will turn ITSI up to 11 by adding the concept of &quot;platforms&quot; as a collection of related services, support reoccurring maintenance windows, and generate rich alerts that include information such as which entities are impacted and what the KPI values are. These concepts are combined so that all the problems in your platform generate a single alert with alert text rich enough that that your support teams can respond without opening ITSI, and we will do it all with just SPL.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Forecasting Disk Usage with Machine Learning – So easy, even a cave-person can do it!</comments>
      <description>This presentation will walk users through how to use the machine learning toolkit to accurately forecast disk usage across their entire environment, giving them the exact day, month, and year when a server will run out of disk space. No more being awakened at 3:00 am for a bridge call due to a drive running out of disk. This process also can be used by capacity planning teams to select a future date and get a clear view of capacity across the business for all servers. Using machine learning to remove tech debt in an organization does not require a data scientist. You can do it if you have the right server metrics and the MLTK installed. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Risk-based alerting is gaining traction in the SOC: by using multiple-lower fidelity searches to yield higher-fidelity investigations, it allows analysts to rapidly prioritize investigations, correlate “risk objects” between alerts, identify gaps in monitoring, and generally understand attack narratives. We&#x27;ll discuss the first steps needed to transition from the traditional one-to-one ticket investigation model to this holistic approach, i.e. how risk-based alerting works, a description of prerequisites, and dashboard optimization.  We will also discuss how to start building a comprehensive search inventory based on Splunk analytics, MITRE, and your own threat intelligence.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) Protocol is one of the most pervasive electronic communications protocols used for real-time exchange of information related to securities transaction and market data. The protocol is used to move massive quantities of money per day. With over 1600 fields (tags) and 115 message types, the protocol presents some unique challenges to consider when developing an add-on for Splunk. Come see and discuss the protocol and how Splunk can help you make sense of the data it contains to improve your trading, business analytic, security, fraud, and compliance operations.&lt;p/&gt;

In this session you&#x27;ll learn what Splunk Cloud Platform has to offer, the core concepts to be successful, and how to use Splunk Developer Cloud (SDC) tools to explore the services and features. Getting started couldn&#x27;t be easier, and we&#x27;ll show you how to go from sign-up to running in just a few clicks. You&#x27;ll be dropped right in the middle of Splunk Investigate where you can access the services and features SCP has to offer (like ingest and search and collaboration tools). But that&#x27;s not all, because using SDC tools you&#x27;ll see how easy it is to create your own app to utilize the same SCP features as Splunk Investigate for your own use cases. Come join us for this end-to-end look at Splunk Cloud Platform, and get your head into the clouds!   &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Going Beyond Inclusion in the Workplace</comments>
      <description>Technology has enveloped our lives - Smart TVs at home, FortNite on your morning commute, to communication with our colleagues… even when they’re the next cubicle over. Before the Internet, people who are blind had to rely on others to read the news to them, unless they were fortunate enough to have access to a braille copy. Today, a staggering amount of information is at their fingertips, thanks to the Internet and screen readers. People with limited mobility can now work home if they choose to. One disability group still faces significant challenges. Over 70% of Deaf sign language users are under- or un-employed. Many people have implicit bias assuming that communication with Deaf and Hard of Hearing employees is difficult, costly, challenging.In this presentation, Davin and Jarlath discuss how offices can not only become accessible, but go beyond creating a culture of inclusion, awareness and equity.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Handling Expanding Data Sources &amp; Datacenter Migration While Strengthening the Nutanix Security Posture with Splunk and HCI</comments>
      <description>Nutanix implemented Splunk to improve operations and security. Attend this session to learn how we started small and grew our Splunk footprint, going from 80 GB/day to 700GB-1.8TB/day, to satisfy key IT and business needs. You will also learn how we leveraged Splunk and our own Nutanix infrastructure for a successful data center migration that involved over 2000 clients and 80+TB of data. We’ll share best practices and insights into running virtualized Splunk Enterprise on hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI). You’ll also learn about an app for Phantom, which we’ll demo, we built to provide security operations teams the ability to quickly contain a VM by stopping or suspending it, then safely starting it, plus the other workloads, like firewall, Docker (incl. Splunk Docker), ETL, etc., we run alongside Splunk on the same infrastructure stack. Whether you’re a Splunk user or own the infrastructure that supports your Splunk team, you’ll get details to help you in your job.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In a world full of AI, wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to foster some Natural Curiosity?  Coming from a Humanities background, I tend to look at data a little differently than most engineers and data scientists. Using Splunk I&#x27;m able to freely navigate through the data and explore different use cases. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Harnessing the Next Generation of Tech Talent</comments>
      <description>Generation Z is our largest generation ever. They are over 2 billion strong and are predicted to make up nearly 30% of the workforce by 2025. Fifty percent of them are likely to have a university degree that will carry them through 17 jobs, spanning five different careers in their lifetime. So how can we harness the energy of this huge pool of &quot;think differently,&quot; &quot;act differently&quot; resources? With an internship program. Learn how the Splunk ANZ team focused on addressing the staffing challenges many tech companies face, particularly with regard to promoting diversity and including underrepresented groups, such as female students studying STEM subjects. This session will review how they built an internship program that not only delivered huge value to the business, including Gen Z diversity, but also focused on transferring technical and soft skills to facilitate their transition into full-time employment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Want to run Splunk on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)? Have a GCP environment you aren’t monitoring in Splunk? In this joint Google &amp; Splunk session, you’ll learn how to architect, build and scale a Splunk environment on GCP according to best practices for availability, performance and cost. We’ll walk you through the setup of a real-world Splunk environment on GCP, as well as the various options available for ingesting valuable Google Cloud data in any Splunk environment. We’ll leverage streaming services from Google Cloud like Pub/Sub and Dataflow to capture in near real-time operational, audit, billing, inventory data, and more. We’ll then demonstrate how to analyze this wealth of data and get immediate insights for several use cases from IT Ops to Security.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Have No Fear, WMI Is Here: Identify Lateral Movement and Malicious Backdoors with Windows Management Instrumentation</comments>
      <description>Attackers are increasingly using a &#x27;living off the land&#x27; approach, often using crypto mining malware, EternalBlue, timing, or other attacks that leverage the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line. These attacks typically don&#x27;t generate any events via conventional Sysmon and PowerShell, so even if you&#x27;re pulling in those logs you likely won&#x27;t see them. Join this session to learn how to detect and protect your organization from these advanced WMI-based attacks.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Wouldn’t it be great if you can just be proactively told when your Splunk deployment needs your attention? Wouldn’t it be simply awesome to go to one place and know exactly what the problem is and how to resolve it? At Splunk we understand that every organization suffers the pain of throwing resources to keep the lights on for their infrastructure environment. Fortunately the new version of Splunk Monitoring helps you know when things are not performing as expected. You can now see health of deployment wide without affecting your search or indexing latency and go through guided set of checks curated from years of support experience to solve issues first hand. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Helping Women in Technology to Boost Their Careers by Getting Public Recognition for Intellectual Property that They Create</comments>
      <description>This session will illuminate the world of Intellectual Property (IP) so that women are more empowered to gain recognition. The underrepresentation of women in STEM has meant that, historically, men have had a reputational advantage, but women can gain ground. IP rights provide an avenue for increased acknowledgement, both inside and outside the company. This session will cover the issues of ownership as well as the different types of IP, and which IP may be most valuable to the company. It also will explain the role of an IP group in a company, and how women can take advantage of their efforts to see their contributions being acknowledged. It also will discuss the business pressures at play, with different company groups and products vying for limited resources. The goal of this session is to give women the information and tools they need to take advantage of opportunities, gaining the much-deserved recognition they deserve, and boosting their professional career in technology!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How Kronos Consolidated Logging and Infrastructure Monitoring with the Splunk App for Infrastructure</comments>
      <description>Monitoring a microservice-based and globally distributed SaaS solution in the public cloud is challenging alone, but doing it with a variety of monitoring and logging tools makes it even harder. Learn how the Kronos Workforce Dimensions team consolidated logging, infrastructure monitoring, and cloud monitoring all within Splunk to facilitate seamless issue detection and correlation in an effort to minimize time to resolution. In this session, we will share our approach and lessons learned with respect to deployment in the cloud, alerting and visualization (dashboards) in our journey of consolidation of tools and leveraging the new Splunk App for Infrastructure app along the way.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How S&amp;P Global Migrated to the Cloud with Splunk</comments>
      <description>S&amp;P Global is undergoing a cloud transformation. As we continue to mature in the  cloud, we are  partnering with Splunk to enable monitoring that is accurate, timely, and actionable. The cloud transformation project was aggressive, and we have exited our primary data centers and have nearly migrated 100% of applications to the cloud within eight months. We are building in the cloud using infrastructure automation, DevSecOps, and continuous monitoring. The cloud environment is by no means simple. It continues to be complex because some applications have migrated to be cloud-native while others are lift and shift. In addition, we are moving to containers and multi-cloud. All those teams use Splunk to monitor for issues and investigate root causes. By integrating and automating our IT services, we have reduced MTTI and MTTR, and increased our productivity. We will share details about our successful implementation story, and provide steps to help you achieve monitoring maturity in changes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How Splunkbase identifies, resolves, and reviews incidents using Splunk&gt;Investigate.</comments>
      <description>As a service that has many different integration points, Splunkbase needs to ensure as much uptime as possible. This means that when an incident occurs the root cause needs to be identified, resolved, reviewed and communicated to all relevant parties in a timely manner. Fortunately, Splunk&gt;Investigate has served us very well in achieving these objectives. In this session, we’ll demonstrate how the use of the Splunk&gt;Investigate app on Splunk Cloud Platform (SCP) enables teams to access the same data pool with appropriate authorization to collaborate using shared workbooks. This workflow enables teams to quickly reach a solution when an incident occurs.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Want to scale Splunk Enterprise Security to 100TB/day? We&#x27;ve done it! In Splunk labs, we built workloads that closely simulate our customers&#x27; usage patterns, and we scaled beyond a 100TB per day ingest rate with search head clustering. In this session we&#x27;ll share key aspects of our Splunk Enterprise Security workload design: diverse source types, major data models, search scenarios, data enrichment, and hardware choices for search head and indexer.  We will also share how different configurations impact search performance and how to tune Splunk Enterprise Security effectively with parameters such as max_searches_per_cpu, acceleration.max_concurrent, allow_skew, and maxBundleSize to name a few. Come see how we scaled to large volumes while efficiently utilizing hardware capacity for maximum performance.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Understanding the intent of a natural language search is a major component of any natural language processing system. Although there are numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex problems in natural language processing, such as understanding intent also known as natural language understanding, very few of them discuss the challenges in production. In this session we take you on a journey from development to production of natural language understanding component of Splunk Natural Language Platform. We will discuss several engineering and data science challenges, and also provide holistic approaches to overcome those challenges. Attendees of the session should walk away with a deeper understanding of different state-of-the-art techniques, such as understanding the intent of a natural language search query, that can help them build their own applications in the natural language processing domain. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Hunting in the Dark: Profiling Encrypted Network Traffic</comments>
      <description>It&#x27;s not easy to detect malicious patterns within encrypted network traffic. JA3, a method of fingerprinting Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) traffic developed by SalesForce, aims to address this by profiling client (JA3) and server (JA3s) SSL connections. Since these fingerprints are unique and persistent, they provide a way to discover applications, fingerprint Operating Systems, and even discover malware. This presentation showcases how to use Splunk to streamline JA3 event data gathered from Bro/Zeek, use that in combination with host-level visibility provided by Carbon Black, and ultimately correlate network signatures with endpoint telemetry. You will learn how to use this method to get a better understanding of what processes are causing benign or malicious SSL connections on your network and how to hunt for unknown threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>For many organizations, Splunk is considered critical infrastructure. But Splunk itself does not provide any full backup solutions. Several first and third-party options exist, each with their own positives and negatives. Join us as we talk about what options exist today, why they didn’t work for us, and what we’ve built to solve this problem - right from Splunk - using the open source tool Duplicity. Users of all OS’s welcome, but the app is currently only supported for Linux.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Improved Methods for Using Selenium with Splunk to Monitor Web Apps</comments>
      <description>Using data that you probably already have in Splunk, you can gain tremendous insight into the performance of your web applications. However, this requires someone to visit your application, and ideally you don&#x27;t want your customers discovering your problems for you. What happens when nobody is looking? What if a part of the site is broken but users just haven&#x27;t tripped over it yet?  We&#x27;ll demonstrate the methods that we developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory using Splunk and open source tools like Selenium to monitor web applications with synthetic interactions that happen in a real browser to verify everything is performing as expected. We&#x27;ll share how to put the pieces together, including configuring Selenium Grid, creating monitoring that thoroughly tests your apps, dashboards that create and test your Selenium interactions for you, getting screenshots and network waterfall data, and our monitoring dashboards that combine test results with existing Splunk data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Improve Your Cyber Monitoring &amp; Response Strategy with Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk Phantom</comments>
      <description>How do you know if your alerting and response processes adequately cover the tactics and techniques that your adversaries will use against you? If you&#x27;re not sure, then how do to you continuously improve to adapt to ever-evolving threats? This session will provide practical guidance on leveraging models like the diamond model, MITRE ATT&amp;CK™, and OODA to deconstruct your monitoring and response program so that you can make strategic improvements and mature it on a strong foundation. Using these frameworks will help your team recognize its own bias in developing use cases, understand how its alerting and response coverage maps to adversary tactics/techniques, and develop and prioritize new use cases. The session will wrap up discussing practical tips for creating a continuous improvement program that helps you leverage Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk Phantom to maintain a strong security posture.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Improving cost-efficiency of inland cargo shipping within the Port of Hamburg – powered by Splunk IoT capabilities</comments>
      <description>The Port of Hamburg is the main entrance to the German market and the third largest European port by transit volume, passing nearly 9 million containers each year. Although it has witnessed several stages of automation, there is still vast, untapped potential to preserve resources, both economic and ecological. By introducing IoT with Splunk, we move away from the docks and onto the vessels, equipping one tugboat and one inland cargo ship with IoT technology to measure movement and gather data about energy consumption from their 1950s diesel engines. The goal of this PoC environment is to automate the communication between ship and port authority, as well as visualize their field of operation to evenly distribute load and optimize the travel distances. On a broader spectrum, we also built a simulation model within our dashboard to investigate the benefits of adapting the vessels with engines powered to natural gas or electricity based on their consumption patterns.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Industrial Cyber Security In A Converging IT/OT World</comments>
      <description>The digital convergence of IT and OT infrastructures promises huge efficiencies, cost savings and opportunities; but it is not without risk. OT was primarily built to run all types of manufacturing &amp; critical infrastructure processes while IT was built to store, transmit and manipulate data in order to conduct business. The two worlds could not be more different in purpose or design; and this can expose even the most secure organizations to new types of cyber threats. In this session we will discuss the current challenges we face in the drive to convergence and how to secure your industrial or critical infrastructure organization from the clear and present threat.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Infrastructure and System Monitoring with Splunk and Telegraf</comments>
      <description>Telegraf is a open source tool that is used for collecting metrics from a variety of inputs, including system data (CPU, memory, disk, and network), docker, MySQL, etc. Telegraf (as of v1.8) supports a &quot;splunkmetric&quot; serializer for native ingest into Splunk&#x27;s metric store using a variety of Telegraf&#x27;s output modules, including file outputs, and HTTP with the ability to include HEC-required fields. Telegraf can be deployed as a stand-alone daemon or as a Splunk application that can be pushed out from deployers, masters, and the like. We&#x27;ll investigate the various integrations with Telegraf and Splunk including using Telegraf as the system to feed Splunk&#x27;s App for Infrastructure (in lieu of collectd), custom dashboards, as well as integrations with ITSI. With Telegraf&#x27;s multitude of inputs, outputs, and a nearly universal run-time, it&#x27;s a fantastic tool to add to your system monitoring workflows.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Infrastructure Insights: Reducing Time by Shining a Light on Siloed IT Landscapes</comments>
      <description>In a highly virtualized environment, getting a clear picture of the infrastructure landscape can be challenging. Because data is siloed between each layer of IT, discovering their relationships is often a manual task involving multiple teams. But using Splunk, building those relationships becomes a breeze. Join us as we discuss how we combine data from the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), Virtual Infrastructure, and Storage Environment to present an easy-to-use interface that allows our users to explore their infrastructure. Troubleshooting issues that used to take a user hours of downloading and parsing data from multiple sources now takes seconds with a click of a button. From finding all applications running on one host to determining which teams to notify for upcoming storage work, we can now quickly show all meaningful relationships between applications, servers, hosts, and storage.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>AV and conference technology may seem trivial to the traditional IT OPS engineer, but it is one of the most visible and expensive parts of an enterprise. Everyone from the CEO to even the new hires on their first day use the technology. At PSE we were able to leverage Splunk to help us build, maintain, and manage our enterprise AV program (and save a lot of money in the process). In this session you will learn how we used Splunk to make data-driven decisions that influence and shape a multi-million dollar AV program.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Integrating the Analyst, the Logic, and the Machine</comments>
      <description>Are your analysts spending too much time clearing through notable events? Ours were too, but today our analysts are living the dream: they have all the details they want right there on the Incident Review screen, all while our alerts fine-tune themselves (with workflow action human input). Come and see how we achieved Incident Review Screen 2.0. by using Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit to transition to smarter correlation searches. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>IBM Z continues to be the cornerstone of the global economy powering the world&#x27;s largest banks, retailers, airlines and insurance companies.   With the adoption of hybrid multicloud a reality for today&#x27;s fast moving businesses, the mainframe is no longer isolated from the rest of the IT infrastructure and is now an integral part of your cloud strategy.   As you expose and integrate your data and applications through APIs and look to gain further insight, any lack of visibility impacts your business&#x27;s ability to deliver key services .  Learn how IBM is not only providing access to the volumes of IBM Z machine data but is also providing valuable insight into that data to both operations and  lines of business. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>In Transition: Helping Veterans Navigate the Transition to Technology Careers</comments>
      <description>More than 200,000 military service members return to civilian life each year in the United States alone, with many thousands more around the globe. Many are looking to build on their experiences, leveraging the technical training and skills acquired while working in the service to their country. Thousands more are looking to change direction. Both paths can lead to the Splunk community, where we have provided access to free training for thousands of veterans through our customers, partners, and more. Join us for a discussion with some of our leading partners, including the Wounded Warrior Project, WithYouWithMe Academy, and Npower, about how veterans can navigate the transition to technology careers with help from a growing network of partners, and how Splunk can provide new and exciting career opportunities.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Introduction to monitoring business operations with Acceleris’ party dashboard</comments>
      <description>Why should running a business feel any different than throwing a party? To demonstrate how Splunk can be used to monitor and manage business operations, the DATA Mavericks team at Acceleris has iteratively perfected its Party Dashboard. It started out as a gimmick at the inauguration party of the company&#x27;s new headquarters, but now the Party Dashboard demonstrates how Splunk’s dashboarding helps any team get real-time visibility into any operation. Join this session to learn why they chose the relevant metrics, how they collected and fed the data to Splunk, and what meaningful insights were generated as a fun introductory example of using Splunk to get visibility into your business operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>“You should be looking at Indicators of Compromise!” exclaims your CISO, regulator, vendor, and mom.  No problem, right? You have the most expensive security intelligence vendor and all you have to do is correlate in your expensive SIEM. If you&#x27;ve tried this, then you are laughing with me. Come hear my exploration into implementing IOCs at a major US insurance company and a major US bank. I’ll address the differences between Indicators of Compromise vs Indicators of Attack, and I will show you how not to use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, plus some tips on how it use it well.  My goal is to save you from falling into the same pitfalls when dealing with Indicators of Crap.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Is it Normal or Suspicious? Detecting Anomalies via Market Basket Analysis</comments>
      <description>Detecting abnormal behavior is an important objective in security monitoring, but is extremely challenging as we mostly are expected to detect &quot;unknown unknowns.&quot; We can, however, use an entity&#x27;s past behavior to measure how much of what we observe today deviates from normal behavior. In this way we can detect unknown, hidden and insider threats early on to stay ahead of advanced threats. This talk presents a unified, scalable framework for anomaly detection that is built on the frequent itemset mining technique. The premise is that if we can align an event with more frequent patterns observed in history, then the event is unlikely to be an anomaly. By mining through an extensive set of features and feature co-occurrences, the model can accurately capture the normal behaviors. Any new behaviors can then be scored. At which point, any new rare co-occurrences of events can be detected and sent to analysts and SOC teams for rapid investigation.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Just a normal day in the office – Data driven business process improvements for a global supply chain company.</comments>
      <description>“Our IT-powered business processes are too slow.” Does this sound familiar? If so, that is usually the perfect starting point to dig in and start improving them. Unfortunately, specific data that could help with that effort are not available – normally. In this session we will show you how we at Arvato Supply Chain Solutions got the data we needed and used it to improve the collaboration between IT and business. You will learn how we connected different IT systems such as SAP and conveyor line to Splunk Cloud, and how this helped us to analyze business processes with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI). And, as the icing on the cake, we give you a sneak peak of the machine learning algorithm we implemented to continuously improve our business processes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk&#x27;s Security Research Team collects attack data in the wild from across the globe and analyzes new and unusual techniques, tactics, and procedures employed by threat actors. We use this data to help customers build tailored defenses—defenses that automatically detect, investigate, and respond to suspicious activities in real time. In this session we will discuss how Splunk security researchers created our own honeypot and data collection framework in response to research demonstrating that honeypots were twice as effective as open-source intelligence feeds at detecting new threats (http://tinyurl.com/y335po8d). We will provide an introduction to honeypots and explain how we architected and built KLAPP-Back, a high-interaction SSH honeypot. We will also discuss how KLAPP-Back helped us build better detection analytics and seed Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Splunk User Behavior Analytics use cases with attacker data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Kubernetes Observability with Splunk Connect for Kubernetes (SCK)</comments>
      <description>Kubernetes is the go-to standard for the automation of deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications. From an observability perspective it is extremely difficult to analyze, troubleshoot and gain actionable insights from these containerized applications. We bridge this gap of observability with the open-sourced Splunk Connect for Kubernetes. Splunk Connect for Kubernetes is the Splunk supported integration to ingest logs, metrics and Kubernetes object state information into Splunk. This session is intended for k8s users and developers who want to make their lives easier leveraging Splunk alongside Kubernetes. Come join the developers who built Splunk Connect for Kubernetes and learn how to configure and run Splunk to monitor your Kubernetes environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Large Scale Threat Hunting in Splunk</comments>
      <description>Threat hunting is hard, and threat hunting in an enterprise network with thousands of endpoints is even harder. We will demonstrate how we leveraged Splunk Enterprise to build an Advanced Threat Hunting platform designed for large scale threat hunting of 100,000 or more endpoints. Using Splunk Enterprise allows us to combine analytics, data enrichment, and custom workflows to display in one platform the most important data to analysts. Our threat hunting platform addresses the challenges of data retention and collection, high false positive rates, and analyst fatigue, all while lowering the time to detection of malicious incidents and improving the efficiency of enterprise SOC operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>We will share experiences and best practices for implementing notable events, the various Splunk Enterprise Security frameworks, and adaptive response actions, and we&#x27;ll share our approach for building a program to consistently develop, measure, and iterate on correlation searches. We will discuss how to integrate lessons learned from incidents, red team engagements, threat intelligence, threat hunting, and requirements from business units into the program. Example tactics we&#x27;ll cover include leveraging low-fidelity detections to develop higher-fidelity and higher-value ones, managing detection content simply and easily through macros, and building a formula to assess the efficacy of your detection content. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk User Behavioral Analytics (UBA) is a machine learning driven solution that helps organizations find hidden threats and anomalous behavior across users, devices, and applications. In this session we&#x27;ll answer questions that came up during our large-scale deployment such as, once you&#x27;ve got UBA installed, how do you know if it is working well in your environment? And how long after installation does it take for the system to be operational and produce results? We&#x27;ll also share best practices for validating outputs and tuning the system. This session will help you jumpstart your understanding of UBA and help you get your UBA deployment into production and detecting threats faster. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>“There’s always a tension between one’s individual self—one’s million data points—and the statistical breakdown of your existence. It’s the awareness of this tension that I navigate each day.” I wrote this in response to the reveal that black employee representation across Splunk’s U.S. offices was only 3%. #RepresentationMatters and having a “seat at the table” are critical frameworks and tactics to improve diversity, and this panel discussion brings together a diverse cross-section of Splunkers to further explore these topics. Specifically, panel participants will use there statistical data points (e.g., 3%) as a foil to reflect on how they’ve leveraged their individual motivations to push for and create change within their particular role. We intend for the audience to leave stirred by the ideas this conversation will open up, and moved to ask themselves what they can do to create change or elevate others who’ve been underrepresented in their workplace.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Los Angeles World Airports - Streamlining event management with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI)</comments>
      <description>Los Angeles World Airport has chosen Splunk&#x27;s ITSI as their centralized event/alert management platform. We’ve consolidated alerts/events from multiple management platforms across the enterprise, reducing help desk churn by grouping similar events, and evaluating the results against smart Key Performance Indicator (KPI) thresholds so that only actionable alerts or events are processed. In addition, we’ve broken down the legacy data siloes through the use of service definitions, glass tables, and deep-dives, providing better insight for all team members. Lastly, we’ve automated ITSI service and dependency creation via the Splunk ServiceNow bi-direction integration App. Plan top attend this session and you will learn how we’ve increased visibility (making data available for everyone); increased efficiency by reducing alert/event noise; improved resolution using ITSI Smart KPIs; and implemented auto service creation via ServiceNow &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Lost In Translation - The Challenge of Managing Microservices</comments>
      <description>Instana CEO Mirko Novakovic explores microservices applications and the performance management challenges created by their complexity. Unique microservice architectures, operational and deployment needs create a large management gap. With so many moving pieces in addition to highly complex architectures, having the raw data won’t meet the challenge. There’s just too many pieces, too many dependencies and too much data for humans (even teams) to understand. New management tools are needed that translate data into information. Otherwise, each stakeholder must fend for themselves even though the ephemeral application architecture makes it impossible to find bottlenecks. It’s like trying to get directions in a foreign city where nobody speaks your language - every question and answer gets lost in translation. Mirko examines distributed microservice applications, how their complexity creates management problems, and what APM tools should do to automatically meet those challenges and deliver high performing applications.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Make Your Security Tools Work Better Together Using Splunk&#x27;s Adaptive Operations Framework</comments>
      <description>Security architectures typically involve many layers of tools and products that are not designed to work together, leaving gaps in how security teams bridge multiple domains to coordinate defense. The Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework (AOF) addresses these gaps by connecting security products and technologies from our partners with Splunk security solutions including Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) and Splunk Phantom. Join this session to learn how the Splunk AOF benefits both users and security technology providers by enabling rich context for all security decisions, collaborative decision-making, and orchestrated actions across diverse security technologies. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Marcus by Goldman Sachs: Monitoring an Online Banking Startup with Splunk</comments>
      <description>Marcus by Goldman Sachs is an online, consumer lending and savings platform, often referred to as a startup within the 150-year-old company. The Marcus platform was designed and built from the ground up using the latest technologies and following agile software practices. Splunk software is used to monitor application and infrastructure logs and supports not only DevOps but also Development, QA, Production Support, and Security teams. This session will cover the challenges and successes we have experienced during our first years of rapid growth, the products and capabilities that we added to our platform this year, and provide a glimpse at the potential role of Splunk Next products in online retail banking use cases in the future.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Maximizing permissioned blockchain throughput using Samsung SDS Accelerator and Splunk MLTK</comments>
      <description>Blockchain scalability is one of the main barriers to adoption of this revolutionary new technology. Finance, supply chain, and e-commerce blockchain deployments often have peak throughputs that far exceed their baseline. For example, when tickets for a popular concert go on sale, the peak transaction throughput will result in unacceptable latency for the users. Samsung SDS Accelerator is a layer 2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric that enables up to 10x transaction throughput during this burst of activity. Using Splunk MLTK, we’re able to detect and react to these bursts of activity without compromising the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Measure What Matters to Streamline Security Operations with Splunk</comments>
      <description>To tame an event queue that&#x27;s ballooning out of control, you need to know first which rules and data sources are generating a disproportionate number of alerts, and second the security value you&#x27;re getting from those rules and data sources. Any changes made to rules or telemetry analyzed without that knowledge risk making your organization more vulnerable. In this session we&#x27;ll discuss how Splunk empowers us to perform advanced analytics on everything from alert conversion rates to human time expenditure on alerts so that we can optimize all processes related to alerting. As long as we know what to measure and where to look, Splunk can help us tune our security operations centers to reduce monotony and false positives without diminishing our ability to detect actual threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk’s metric index has changed a lot since we launched it back in Splunk Enterprise 7.0. In this latest iteration, we have upgraded our data model and metric index to natively ingest and store multiple metrics in a single event to further reduce its storage footprint and lower total cost of ownership. This session with provide a deep-dive into our latest metric index layout, its evolution since introduction in Splunk Enterprise 7.0, and how it varies from a log index storage layout.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Why is the queue for the women’s restroom always longer than the men’s at a concert or theater? Data is fundamental to the modern world. From business decisions to economic development and public policy, we rely on data to allocate resources and make critical decisions. However, because so much of the data fails to take into account bias, such as gender and race, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. This results in missed economic opportunities and tremendous costs in time, in money and, in some cases, lives. In this session we will explore examples of data bias based on studies that are eye-opening, informative, and will change the way you look at the world. We will look at the pitfalls that lead to poor data-driven decisions, and their outcomes. We also will explore the steps you can take to inform your own data driven decisions. And, yes, we will answer the question, “Why is the women’s queue is longer than the men’s?”&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Modernize and Mature Your SOC with Risk-Based Alerting</comments>
      <description>Today SOCs are in desperate need of a different alerting approach. Texas Instruments (TI) decided to transform its SOC by using risk-based alerting to generate fewer, higher fidelity alerts, and by aligning to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, which provides more situational awareness to analysts. This risk-based approach reduces false positives and the situational numbness associated with the legacy whitelisting process. Splunk and TI will walk you through TI&#x27;s SOC successes as it transitioned to risk-based alerting. TI will detail a few real-life risk-based rule examples, discuss learning curves to fast track your transition, and discuss how MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ fits in with this approach.  After this session, you will have the foundation to embark on your risk-based alerting journey, allowing you to increase detection mechanisms, increase your coverage of the ATT&amp;CK™ techniques, and improve the overall effectiveness of your SOC.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Monitoring the order fulfilment process within an automated warehouse using Splunk Business Flow</comments>
      <description>Attendees will see how Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow are used to monitor the order fulfilment process within an automated warehouse in real time. You also will see how proactive alerts inform the warehouse that a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is under performing. Then, using process mining to investigate, find the root cause to solve issues before they become problems. This presentation will initially describe the workings of an automated warehouse and the data generated. It then will cover the process of ingesting this data into Splunk and configuring Splunk Business Flow to monitor processes and KPIs. Finally, the session will review the benefits to TGW and its customers from deploying Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow. Come to the session to see how the monitoring, alerting, and process mining functionality in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow provides a deep insight into what is happening inside an automated warehouse.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Next Generation Data Ingestion and Preparation with Splunk</comments>
      <description>You think data ingestion into Splunk is cumbersome today? Don’t enjoy writing Technology Add-ons (TA) for specific use cases? Then this talk is for you!  We will walk through data ingestion using the data sources supported by the new Splunk Investigate wizard. This allows users of all levels to configure their data source and perform various manipulation functions on the ingested data to make sure it meets their use case. We will also go over the guiding principles of the underlying Data Stream Processing (DSP) pipeline which empowers the user to add their own customizations and send data to a variety of destinations.   We will compare this with current Splunk Enterprise data ingestion process by configuring a TA for a specific use case and then alter the ingested data to the desired format before sending it to an index. The user will be able to draw a contrast between the two approaches and see how it does not have to take up to 6 weeks to acquire and prepare data for analytics in Splunk. We hope this session leaves the user excited about data ingestion and prep.    &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>We will share our journey, lessons, and observations from the past year of implementing compliance at the MITRE Corporation. We&#x27;ll recap our path from initially learning about Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), also known as NIST 800-171, to complying with it. We&#x27;ll share insights from the process that may help you in your compliance journey, but we&#x27;ll also discuss how your journey might be different than ours, as one size never fits all with compliance. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In this session, we’ll explore how companies can adapt to multi-cloud environments using Google Cloud Anthos and Splunk Enterprise to maintain end-to-end visibility into these hybrid workloads. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) On-Prem part of Anthos brings the efficiency, speed, and scale of cloud to manage Kubernetes clusters in your datacenter. Combined with Splunk Connect for Kubernetes, we’ll show you how you get a single pane of glass to manage, monitor &amp; secure your Kubernetes clusters across your organization. We’ll also do a deep dive on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) security controls and how to export security findings from Cloud Security Command Center and cloud asset changes from Cloud Asset Inventory all into Splunk Enterprise for further forensic analysis, to accelerate incident resolution and ensure compliance.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you want to be an ally but don&#x27;t know where or how to start? Diversity and inclusion in technology workplaces is not a women’s issue, or an issue relevant only to other underrepresented groups. Diversity and inclusion are business issues, and they are human issues. We know that businesses profit from the many benefits that diverse perspectives bring to innovation and company competitiveness. In this panel discussion, we aim to facilitate a conversation to better understand the barriers to advocacy, to promote best-practices for effective advocacy, and to enable sharing of first-hand experiences of successful advocacy.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Predict Real World Outage using Splunk MLTK</comments>
      <description>Do you want to predict an outage before it happens? Are you wondering how to pursue the incremental journey to Artificial Intelligence Operations (AIOps)? This case study will reveal a real-world use case from T-Mobile USA and show you how to predict cell tower congestion in advance using Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit. In the age of binge watching on cell phones and wireless broadband services, cell congestion reduces speed and reliability and results in buffered video streaming and/or dropped calls that dents the use of services and the revenue. Building forecasting models for congestion requires correlation of several parameters including seasonal variations. Doing this on a large scale in real time takes significant resources. In this session, attendees will learn about the journey to build this predictive capability, including data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, benefits, and lessons learned. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Protecting your Data: The 2020 Decennial Census and Data Security</comments>
      <description>The Census is the nation’s largest peacetime mobilization effort and determines congressional representation. Census data is used by businesses, governments and civic organizations to inform decision-making and this year the Census is going mobile and online for the first time. This means that security is a top priority in ensuring the success of the 2020 Decennial. This segment of the conference will explore security related topics to include vulnerabilities, scalability and performance, with a special focus on Data Privacy, Compliance and Reputational Threat Management. If all things data and IT Security excite you, then this session is for you. Census executives Atri Kalluri and Zack Schwartz will provide a behind the scenes overview of the systems supporting the 2020 Decennial, including Splunk, and real world case studies on how the Census Bureau is adopting best practices across IT security and social media monitoring to ensure the security of respondent data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Ever wanted to create a seamless sign-on experience for your Splunk users, irrespective of when, where, who, or how many? If so come and listen to how Atlassian, the world leader in software collaboration tools, did just that. Atlassian’s in-house Splunk Enterprise cluster runs on Amazon Web Services and we wanted to take advantage of the latest and greatest authentication features released for the Application Load Balancer to provide that much-sought-after, seamless SSO experience for all our Splunk users. Join us as we share the technical wrangling required to make this magic happen and expand on how we leveraged the Splunk scripted authentication mechanism to introduce support for JSON web toke- based authentication. The cherry on top will be the chance to discover some of the unexpected things we learned along the way, because no tale is complete without a war story and everyone loves a great war story!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>You knew it had to happen, Splunk is migrating to Python 3! We want this migration to be as painless as possible for apps and scripts developers, but it necessitates some compatibility requirements. This talk will dive into what parts of your apps and scripts will have to become Python 3 compatible. You’ll explore approaches to using Python community supplied backporting libraries as well as Python 2/3 compatible native syntax. By examining common and uncommon gotchas we found while migrating Splunk Enterprise, we will make sure you are prepared to run your code in the future generations of Splunk Enterprise!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Real-time public transport information systems monitoring and analysis in the city of Amsterdam </comments>
      <description>With around a million people interacting with the public transport in and around the city of Amsterdam daily, supplying accurate travel information is critical for an efficient and well-informed public transportation experience. With four different transport types (boat, bus, tram, and metro) and a host of custom systems creating around 4.5 million update events per day, analyzing this travel information depends on everything working seamlessly together. To provide accurate and trustworthy real-time passenger information services, monitoring of not only information availability but quality is needed. This use case shows how Splunk was implemented to monitor the data streams at all points in the information chain, and how real-time insights and alerting allows for proactive problem resolution and provides high-quality real-time information services for the end-user.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Real-world strategies for Kubernetes &amp; docker integrations with Splunk</comments>
      <description>Have you jumped on the Kubernetes train and are now thinking about your logging strategy? Or are you considering migrating your application to a microservices architecture like Docker and want to proactively plan your logging strategy? The data capture methods and data format can be significantly different from what you used in the past. Additionally, multi-line events need to be accounted for. There are a few different ways to ingest this data into Splunk. For example, Splunk &#x27;Kubernetes Connect&#x27; leverages Fluentd behind the scenes. There also is a Splunk logging plugin for docker, and a syslog logging plugin. The Splunk Universal Forwarder also can be deployed on a sidecar. What the pros and cons with so many choices? This session will help you sort it all out.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>A large volume of known production incidents and end-user issues are still being resolved manually. This becomes worse when it happens in unusual hours and no one is there to fix it. Every minute of downtime is detrimental to business and waking up an engineer at the middle of the night to fix simple known issues is not worthwhile. Our self-healing (Event-Driven Remediation) solution fixes simple and known incidents automatically. For complex alerts, it gets relevant diagnostics and context from the logs. This could massively improve customers&#x27; and employees&#x27; experience in any organization.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Retaining Talent and Striking a Work-Life Balance via Job-Sharing</comments>
      <description>Who says you can’t have it all? In today’s workplace, where the competition for talent is fierce, offering a true work/life balance is the key to keeping the best and the brightest as part of your organization. Based on more than 15 years of experiences across Fortune 500 companies and startups in the technology industry, Pam Sotnick and Katy Mann have been trailblazers in job-sharing and have shown how it works; not just for employees but also for organizations. Striking the right balance helps to retain talented women or men who need to reduce the number of hours devoted to their work life due to family responsibilities or other considerations. Job-sharing also can help to retain skilled workers who might otherwise choose to retire early or move to another organization. Come learn how job-sharing can work for your organization or how to make it work for you as an individual.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Many government agencies and for-profit companies require that you run Splunk on a network disconnected from the outside Internet. This presents many challenges, including how to cross air gaps and one-way transfers, how to operate indexers in an air-gapped environment, and how to automate backwards.

      <comments>Saving the Nation’s Food Supply with Data-Driven Analytics</comments>
      <description>Copper River ES, a strategic partner for Splunk public sector, is working with a large federal agency that has restructured their NOC and SOC organizations into a single unified entity as part of operational optimization.  The agency is responsible for protecting IP and other assets totaling $4.3 trillion as part of safeguarding the nation’s food supply chain.   The goal was to enhance the ability to handle problem escalations quickly and improve communications between teams. They are currently ingesting more than 3TB daily across 65 data sources where Splunk is leveraged as an integrated data platform and framework service to act as a nerve center for the combined NOC and SOC teams. Implementation has resulted in dramatically reducing MTTD to an average of less than 30 min compared to previous times of up to 12 hours, MTTR times from 16 hours to often less than 1 with overall outage times having now been reduced by about 68%. From a security perspective, it is used to identify data exfiltration and insider threats, as well as for security operations and compliance.  Increasing visibility into all aspects of system operations and troubleshooting efforts is now supported through a series of custom Splunk App’s, glass tables, reports and alerts with operational guides and training to best leverage the capabilities Splunk has generated.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Scary (Spooky?) Fast Intelligence-Based Hunting with Splunk Phantom</comments>
      <description>Organizations today struggle with quickly and consistently applying behavior-based threat intelligence across their security tools. The hours needed to stitch together this information manually leave analysts unprepared to quickly turnaround questions from management about their vulnerability to threats that their management sees in the news. In this session we will demonstrate how to use Splunk Phantom to reduce that time lag by automating your threat hunts. Specifically, we will show you how to use Yet Another Recursive Algorithm (YARA) rules on endpoint and network security tools automatically and simultaneously. We will use a case study to show the benefits achieved from this playbook: better reporting, more robust procedures, faster time to detect malware variants, and generally more efficient and effective threat hunts.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Securing the Intelligent Enterprise with SAP Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk</comments>
      <description>Looking to eliminate blind spots across your SAP environment and take proactive action to detect and mitigate attacks before mission-critical ERP applications are compromised? SAP recently teamed with Splunk to help a leading manufacturer build and validate a first-of-it’s-kind bi-directional integration between SAP Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk. See a demo of how Enterprise Threat Detection’s open, extensible framework enables an exchange of alerts with Splunk to facilitate real-time attack investigations from either platform plus the ability to rapidly take action within the SAP landscape or broader heterogenous infrastructure.SAP Enterprise Threat Detection is a powerful native SAP HANA application that quickly identifies suspicious patterns at the application server and database level. When a potential SAP software-specific threat is identified, Enterprise Threat Detection can send an alert to Splunk to correlate with other application and infrastructure data for deeper investigation or trigger immediate action. Conversely, InfoSec teams using Splunk to rapidly identify anomalies across the broader security infrastructure can send alerts to Enterprise Threat Detection for forensics or to trigger appropriate actions in the SAP environment. The combination of Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk enables organizations to more effectively combat security issues across the enterprise spanning applications and infrastructure.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Your network is speaking to you! Listen to what your applications are saying. Monitoring the metrics already present in your wire data can provide the key to understanding and characterizing their performance. Using tools like Splunk Stream, you can collect dozens of metrics at the IP, TCP, and Application layers. This session will show you how to characterize the performance of your applications and the network, and how to tell which is the source of trouble. We&#x27;ll also explore how to perform service and asset discovery with wire data as a basis of fact, correlating it with your database &quot;of record&quot; to ensure its accuracy.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know. With vast amounts of cloud data coming in at cloud-speed, it can be difficult to see through the noise and know what to look for. Are malicious adversaries attempting to comprise the environment? Is my environment under- or over-provisioned? Do I have an insider possibly exfiltrating company data? Are employees actually using the services? What is all of this costing per service, department, business unit? Don&#x27;t worry, we will help you figure all this out in a prescriptive manner by showcasing these and other use cases. Then, we will show you the &quot;how&quot; by exposing the searches, the data needed, and showing you how to onboard that data. You will walk away with use cases that can be implemented immediately in your own environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Dive into the inner workings of SmartStore. In this talk we&#x27;ll go over how SmartStore works internally with ties to Indexer Clustering, and what decisions the CacheManager makes, e.g., when do we upload/download from the remote storage, etc. We&#x27;ll also go over the performance numbers that we&#x27;ve seen!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Solar Analytics: Changing the World One Solar Panel At A Time</comments>
      <description>Solar generation and energy storage is dramatically dropping in cost and is being deployed on a massive scale across the globe. However, system monitoring and diagnostics, cost reporting, and usage can be difficult. With Splunk Essentials for ICS (Industrial Control Systems) and Splunk IAI (Industrial Asset Intelligence), a smart energy solution easily can be created. Does it seem too hard to onboard data? See how we use the Splunk add-on builder to create technology add-ons for solar panels and batteries. Want better visibility? Using Splunk IAI, we can gain faster insights into the performance of solar panels, inverters, and battery systems. Want to understand the economics? By applying business analytics, we can easily report of revenue, costs, and total return on investment. This solution can be applied to both small and large solar and energy storage installations, and we have a real world use case with some exciting energy data!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk as a Tool for DevOps Acceleration</comments>
      <description>DevOps adoption requires high performing teams. One of the biggest challenges organizations have when adopting a DevOps framework is how to get early wins, get value early in the process, and overcome plateaus in adoption. These improvements are typically achieved through the use of automation, improved responsiveness, better situational awareness, and increased sharing between teams. As you will see in this session, Splunk easily sits in the middle of all of this.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>This session will cover how to overcome any missing insights in services and processes in Splunk Cloud. You&#x27;ll learn how to develop alerts and dashboards to show performance and infrastructure health, and an API framework to retrieve data from the cloud infrastructure. We also will show you how to automate retrieval of all entry points to the Splunk on-premises infrastructure, and monitor connections to the intermediate forwarders, deployment servers, HEC and DBX servers, and syslog. In addition, we will address the lack of standardization principles for your on-premises Splunk Infrastructure, how to create gold standard alerts and dashboards, and how to create scripted inputs to gather system information. Finally, we will show you how to address the lack of a centralized view for managing your Splunk deployment server infrastructure, and how to automate the retrieval of deployment clients, server classes, and TA’s from deployment servers and feed the output to Splunk Cloud.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunking Crime Part II - Analysing Bias in Police Actions</comments>
      <description>Last year at .conf18 we used Splunk and Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to analyze and predict the crime in London. This year we are taking a step forward and analyzing the bias in the police actions in the U.K. We will use police, population, religion, and race data to understand how police use their powers in different areas on people from different racial backgrounds. We will use open data sources and index them in Splunk. Using advanced visualizations we will analyze the data and understand more about police actions. Then using MLTK we will create a predictive model for crimes and then analyze the model for any bias due to the data provided. Machine bias is a real issue nowadays when machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used by government agencies to predict crime and even pass sentences on convicts. We need to understand that along with having positive impact of predicting crime, it can have a long-lasting negative impact as well.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk like your life depends on it</comments>
      <description>Many of the talks at .conf will be around how to solve business problems, how to configure clusters, and how to improve your KPIs. This talk focuses instead on how to monitor and detect problems in the physical realm: IoT. What do you do when an agency&#x27;s or business&#x27;s security posture is a matter of life and death? What are they doing to equip themselves against cyberattacks? This talk will discuss previous security breaches and industrial IoT device failures that result in death, and how they could have been detected or prevented with Splunk. It also will give you actionable takeaway&#x27;s for you to implement. After all, security isn&#x27;t always saving dollars; sometimes it is actually about saving lives.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk Machine learning and self healing at Priceline</comments>
      <description>Do you want to rely on manual intervention to fix your application if something goes wrong? In this deep-dive session you will learn how Priceline uses machine learning to find outliers and anomalies in various data sets, including but not limited to bookings, search patterns, changes in logging patterns, etc. You will learn how we used machine learning combined with predictive analytics to solve variety of use cases. For example, we collect Kafka offset data, which is sending data to their respective syncs. We also monitor to see if the traffic is receded or data consumption has increased or decreased unexpectedly. We will show how different stages of application states are controlled with the use of data and alerts, like disabling the app and enabling it according to the data. We also will show you how Priceline deals with brownouts, the gradual degradation of volumes by using machine learning over long periods, using different self healing techniques and custom apps. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Many Fortune 500 companies use Pivotal Cloud Foundry to push its high-quality code into production faster. While this helps companies enforce enterprise logging and application development standards, the traditional monitoring tools used to monitor development environments become the bottleneck because they are not architected to handle a firehose-nozzle connection. Learn how to use the new Splunk ITSI module for PCF, along with the new version of Splunk Firehose Nozzle for PCF to gain operational insight into PCF platform and increase developer satisfaction.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunk Performance: making hardware and platform choices</comments>
      <description>Splunk Enterprise is powerful. Don&#x27;t cheat yourself of its power. When making decisions as to how to expand or standup Splunk’s footprint, you need to know what matters when making platform decisions. Considering compute, storage, virtualization, cloud infrastructure is a lot. There isn’t one place to review all the options you have. We will share the Splunk way to think of performance and how it relates to the underlying system resources. This means getting into the real nuts and bolts of performance. If you want to know how search affects indexing and what resources get consumed, this is the session to attend. If you also want to know how it affects what you purchase as a platform choice, this also is the session to attend. We also will review how partners have built architectures to simplify this process.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Maturing and scaling your security operations rests on your ability to process and analyze huge volumes of often unrelated data in real time. But today&#x27;s tools notoriously overwhelm SOC analysts with the sheer number of alerts and high percent of false positives, resulting in confusion about what tools to use for investigation and response. In this session, members of Splunk&#x27;s Security Research Team will discuss the next generation of Enterprise Security Content Updates that they developed, which integrate the entire Splunk for Security product suite to create a robust end-to-end defense—detection, investigation, and response. We will go over how to use these security guides, which will leverage Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Splunk User Behavior Analytics. We&#x27;ll also highlight the Run Story feature we built to operationalize ESCU Analytics stories and share tools and techniques customers can use to write and test their own use cases.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>If you’re not investing in new technology, you are going to be left behind! One of the key challenges within any state government agency is ensuring system and application performance, SLA enforcement, secure operations, and adhering to strict federal and state compliance mandates, all while operating with limited budgets and staff. With help from Splunk, Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies manage systems that issue public benefits to citizens, maintain child welfare, enforce child support, and monitor public health. Come to this session to learn how to leverage Splunk to help you understand the &quot;complete picture&quot; of your systems and business processes to help your team move toward proactive management and increase customer satisfaction within your governmental applications. Create something useful from millions and billons of lines of log data to improve your application!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>DATEV provides information services to ~2.5 million payrolling, accounting, and tax clients. Given the sensitivity of the personal and financial data that our clients process, DATAEV decided to establish a SOC to secure our clients&#x27; information, and we put Splunk at the core of its operations. In this session we will discuss four key elements relevant to building a successful SOC with Splunk. We&#x27;ll first discuss how we formed our SOC and orchestrated its activities internally. We&#x27;ll then discuss how we use MITRE&#x27;s ATT&amp;CK™ framework to prioritize activities, how we spread our SOC&#x27;s security knowledge to all relevant groups at DATEV, and how we use Splunk to create real-time situational awareness for different SOC customers, for stakeholders, and for management.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Survival of the Fastest: The 1-10-60 Rule</comments>
      <description>Winston Churchill once said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.&quot; Then again, Churchill wasn’t in cybersecurity...While our successes are certainly never final, our failures can absolutely be fatal—to a company and our continued employment. What&#x27;s a good way to actually measure success and failure, though, outside of not appearing on the front page of the paper? Well, as CrowdStrike notes, you have on average one minute to detect an attack in progress, ten minutes to understand it, and sixty minutes to contain it. We will show how to use this 1-10-60 Rule as a measuring metric and leverage the data and capabilities within Splunk and its ecosystem to ensure that we win the survival of the fastest.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Data Fabric Search (DFS) is a paradigm shift from native Splunk and introduces several new innovative concepts such as core scaling and federated search. This sparks questions regarding: How to maximize search performance using DFS conf parameters? How to size the DFS Spark cluster? and What search time speed ups can I expect with DFS? This discourse aims to answer these questions and presents DFS best practices in the context of improving and discovering business use cases. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Take Control of Port 514!: Taming the Syslog Beast</comments>
      <description>Are you frustrated with the task of configuring syslog servers yourself to properly ingest data into Splunk? Take control of the syslog beast once and for all and point your &quot;514&quot; traffic to the new Splunk Connect for Syslog! This new Splunk-supported connector makes quick work of past struggles with syslog servers, sourcetyping, data enrichment, and scale. In this session we will dive into the configuration of the Splunk Connect for Syslog to properly filter, sourcetype, and format your data. We will demonstrate several out-of-the-box examples, highlighting new functionality such as HEC and Kafka transport for resiliency and scale, simple extensions for new device types, and data enrichment that extends far beyond simple sourcetyping of the raw message. Lastly, we will look forward to the integration of syslog with Splunk&#x27;s new Data Stream Processor, and highlight appropriate use cases for each solution. By the time we wrap up, you will know how to tame the syslog beast!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Tales From a Threat Team: Lessons and Strategies for Succeeding with a Risk-Based Approach</comments>
      <description>We&#x27;ve run a risk-based approach with our security alerts for over a year, and we&#x27;re excited to review our progress with you. We&#x27;ll discuss how we increased the number of behavioral indicators by 300% while reducing our alerts by 50%. We&#x27;ll also discuss how we expanded our risk approach to handle on premise and cloud environments within the same framework, which yielded a single alerting mechanism that leverages all of our data enrichment. We&#x27;ll also share the roadmap for our risk-based approach, which incorporates risk rules that utilize algorithms to identify risks not discovered by traditional detection approaches.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Teaching Splunk to Hear: Audio Spectrum Analysis in Splunk for Event Classification and Anomaly Detection</comments>
      <description>If we hear a nearby gunshot, we instinctively react. A mechanic often knows their machine&#x27;s sound so well that they can diagnose issues by sound alone. While machines can be given analytical capabilities with machine learning (ML), sensing human inputs - like auditory or other sensory data - in a form that machines can understand is challenging. In Splunk, we have been all about making machine data accessible to humans, but what if we flip that and make human data accessible to machines? I take audio captured from live and recorded sources and using Fast Fourier transform feed it into Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) for classification and anomaly detection. Can we use Splunk to detect gunshots? Can we learn a machine’s normal sounds to detect pending failures? This presentation uses Splunk to apply superhuman ML detection and learning capabilities to human data to show that the MLTK contains accessible tools you can apply to your IT and security problems. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The Cloud Gateway: A Security Deep-Dive and the Future Ahead</comments>
      <description>The Cloud Gateway is at the heart of many of Splunk’s most exciting products: Mobile, AR, NLP. It facilitates the communication from your iOS, Android, and AppleTV devices with an on-premise Splunk instance without having to set up a VPN or manage firewall rules. The connection is encrypted end to end, so even if Cloud Gateway was compromised your data would still be secure. In this session we’re going to share how Cloud Gateway provides these guarantees by doing a deep dive into the encryption used, the device authentication process, and the flow of a message from a mobile device to a Splunk instance and back again. Finally, we’re going to be talking about some exciting features rolling out to Cloud Gateway in the coming year.&lt;p/&gt;

Data exfiltration by insiders is a dangerous threat, but one that often doesn&#x27;t get the same level of attention as the sexier external ones. We&#x27;ll start this session with a brief overview of why and how users exfiltrate information, and we&#x27;ll progress to tactics, such as effective SPL searches, for operationalizing insider threat detection. You&#x27;ll leave this session better able to catch insider threats in the in the act of exfiltration instead of days, weeks, or months later. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The most epic road trip to .Conf: IOT in an RV, OMG</comments>
      <description>Splunk .conf is our favorite event every year and we wanted to extend the excitement while getting even more Splunky. So we grabbed an RV, set up some sensors, built an edge computing environment, and packed up the Big Data Beard recording equipment for a road-trip across the country for the week leading up to .conf, traveling from New York City to Las Vegas. We stopped along the way to hear awesome stories from fellow Splunk users, sharing them online via live chats and podcasts. With the power of Splunk, we captured data, discovered trends, predicted failures, and discovered more exciting ways to use Splunk to drive value from machine-generated data across the country. Hear the full story of how three engineers had the most interesting trip to .conf2019 of all!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The path to operational enlightenment. An introduction to wire data with Splunk Stream.</comments>
      <description>Have you ever wondered what Joe meant when he referred to “Wire Data”? Today, you&#x27;ll see the applicability of wire data in your organization, and you&#x27;ll be amazed. Solve fraud, cybersecurity, ops, and business challenges, all with one single source of data. Wire data is the information that passes over computer and telecommunications networks to define communications between client and server devices. It is the result of decoding wire and transport protocols containing the bi-directional data payload. We will cover the use of wire data to solve security, IT operations, and business use cases, and see how the Splunk Stream platform is easily integrated into your existing data flows. The Splunk Essentials for Wire Data app from Splunkbase will be used to showcase dozens of examples using wire data to solve common business and technical issues. We will cover how to deploy and configure Splunk Stream in a distributed environment, including a demonstration.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>This presentation will discuss how Security Operation Centers (SOCs) will need to change to meet the cybersecurity challenges of the 2020s. The speaker will draw on his experience as a founder of the first SOC-as-a-Service company that delivers managed security services using Splunk. Most industry analysts envision that the next generation of SOCs will leverage AI, Big Data, and the Cloud, but how far can automation take us and is the concept of an autonomous SOC really practical? How will the SOC of the Future address the global shortage of cyber professionals? How will the role of security analysts need to change? Will the SOC of the Future still need to be housed in dedicated physical facilities? The speaker will provide a blueprint of Proficio’s vision of the SOC of the Future using Splunk and provide a playbook for IT leaders and aspiring IT leaders on how to drive continuous improvement in productivity and measurable outcomes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Threat Hunting in Industrial (ICS\OT) Environments</comments>
      <description>Industrial operations comprise a diverse blend of technology that run critical processes. The proliferation of automation and networking has increased the sophistication of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), also known as Operational Technology (OT) environments.Threats targeting OT are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. Dragos tracks 9 OT-targeting activity groups, the most significant of which, XENOTIME, was responsible for the TRISIS malware that targeted safety systems (SIS) resulting in multiple plant shutdowns and the potential to cause harm to human operators.Traditional IT threat hunting is not well-suited to OT environments. This session will outline the differences between IT and OT assessments, highlight the most significant threats facing OT, and review best practices for OT-specific threat hunting engagements, including techniques that empower defenders to detect and respond more efficiently to existing and future threats, therefore reducing adversary dwell time.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Unified Observability with OpenTelemetry</comments>
      <description>We now live in a Cloud Native world where we build and deploy software very differently from the previous generation. Large, centralized systems are being decoupled and distributed to address scalability needs and to allow companies to deliver value faster. Compared to monolithic applications, microservice architectures introduce complexity in network communication, feature much shorter life cycles, and require resiliency in dynamic environments. As companies began to build or migrate to microservice architectures they often run into operational complexity and struggle to efficiently monitor their environments. These challenges have highlighted the need to observe systems differently and lead to the rise of Observability. In this session, we will discuss OpenTelemetry and how it provides visibility into both distributed traces and metrics. We will walk through the architecture including client libraries and collection as well as cover key concepts including annotations, sampling policies and more. Live demos and coding examples will be presented through the talk. By the end of the session, you will know what OpenTelemetry is, why it is important, how you can get started and how you can get involved.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Paychex’s goal of providing the best user experience for our clients has led to a significant investment in performance testing and monitoring of our applications. Currently all Paychex applications record the execution time for every task and subtask to logs. These are indexed by Splunk, allowing us to identifying areas where changes to code and database queries will have a positive impact on the overall user experience. This presentation will focus on combining this user experience data with client demographic data (such as the number of active employees) and using the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit to build predictive models of user experience based on client demographic data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Obtaining data to develop defenses against threats is a constant challenge for security analysts. To that end, Splunk&#x27;s Security Research team developed the Splunk SIEMulator, a framework modeled after Chris Long&#x27;s DetectionLab that allows a defender to replay attack scenarios using AttackIQ in a simulated environment. SIEMulator’s Attack Range environments are all configured with Splunk forwarders and the apps necessary to create and store data in CIM data models. We&#x27;ll show you how to use the SIEMulator to produce shareable data that can help security analysts replicate scenarios and effectively detect, investigate, and respond to threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Finding anomalies in network data is no easy task, especially when you have terabytes of logs per day to analyze. But have no fear, we’re going to teach you how. In this session we will perform a technical deep dive into how a global content delivery network provider is using Splunk’s Machine Learning Toolkit to discover anomalies in network traffic. We’ll take you on a data science journey and show you how we tested multiple anomaly detection techniques, overcame challenges, fine-tuned detections, and ultimately arrived at meaningful alerts based on machine learning.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Vectra customers and security researchers respond to some of the world’s most consequential threats. And they tell us that there’s a consistent set of questions they must answer when investigating any attack scenario.Yet, security data today is broken and unable to effectively answer those questions. It is either incomplete or storage and performance intensive.  Most teams don’t have the information necessary to properly answer the questions required to support their use cases; whether it be for threat hunting, investigations or supporting custom tools and models.In this session, hear about real-world use cases where security teams use machine learning engines to derive unique security attributes and how it is embedded into security workflows.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Splunk and DNS to detect that your domains are being abused for phishing</comments>
      <description>As a high-profile public-sector organization, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration deals with criminals claiming to be representatives of the organization and contacting the public with phishing e-mails every day. By using Splunk and RFC’s like, RFC7208 – Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, we have developed a technique to identify phishing attacks that are carried out under the disguise of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This technique is universally applicable. A precondition is access to the DNS logging. By means of this technique, insight can be obtained where the phishing e-mails are sent from and to whom the phishing e-mails are sent. In this talk we will start by explaining which standards are available to increase e-mail security and how we have build an app in Splunk, including dashboard and a wizard to create the necessary DNS records to gain insight information about the abuse of our domains.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Splunk Data Stream Processor as a Streaming Engine for Apache Kafka</comments>
      <description>Do you use Kafka but find yourself limited by what Kafka allows you to do with your data? Would you like to enrich, aggregate, and alert on your data as it moves through Kafka, but can’t figure out how? You can overcome these obstacles by integrating Kafka with the Splunk Data Stream Processor. The Splunk DSP is a data streaming platform that helps you transform and enrich your data. With DSP you can make data-driven decisions in real time as data is ingested. DSP also provides simple ways to build data pipelines, and gives you full control and visibility into your data as it flows through the platform. Apache Kafka is now widely adopted as a foundational element for data pipelines. DSP integrates seamlessly with Kafka clusters, and allows data to be read from Kafka, processed in highly scalable ways, and then written back to Kafka. Join us and see how to use DSP as a streaming engine for Kafka clusters.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>We helped our client use Splunk to disrupt theft rings plaguing its retail stores. We&#x27;ll present how we took in public wifi data, tracked MAC addresses that appeared in multiple stores, and ultimately created a system in Splunk that alerted in-store loss prevention teams when individuals likely to be involved in theft rings entered the store. We&#x27;ll go over the steps taken to operationalize our theft deterrence program so that you can adopt it in your organization or modify it to fit your needs.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Vagrant and Splunk Development: Building Splunk Apps for any Environment</comments>
      <description>Vagrant is virtualization technology that builds portable, virtual software development environments. Leveraging this technology for Splunk development allows agile and DevOps teams to easily collaborate in Splunk development in as way that tightly mirrors their production environment, even when working with a mix of environments such as Mac and Windows. Vagrant’s multi-machine environments can perfectly replicate any Splunk architecture, including complicated clustering and networking configurations, using a single Vagrantfile that can be shared directly or committed to a version control system. From the Forwarder to a search head cluster member, see how your configurations and code work in your environment across the entire data pipeline right on your machine, or test your Splunkbase app on every possible architecture from single server to distributed multi-site clusters, all with a single command: vagrant up.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Walking the Talk for Diversity and Inclusion in Cybersecurity</comments>
      <description>We believe that to best defend against global security threats, an organization needs defenders who represent the diverse world that we live in. Every business will benefit greatly by bringing more people to the table with varying skills, backgrounds, leadership and views to combat the diverse adversaries out there. Here at Splunk, we have created initiatives like the &quot;Developing Superwomen in Cybersecurity&quot; program that works to diversify and equalize the cybersecurity workforce to women and other underrepresented groups. Come hear how we are taking action by making cybersecurity accessible to all with this program and some practical advice on how you can do the same when you go back to your organization! You&#x27;ll receive tips on how to make information security inclusive to all with ways of engaging your staff at various levels and receive a blueprint for running your own gamified security experiences, allowing you to up-level staff while embracing their unique talents and backgrounds.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Want to Turbocharge your Developer Pipeline?</comments>
      <description>Do you want to help your developers waste less time on issues and spend more time optimizing build times using Splunk? Do you want to improve developer satisfaction while cutting build times by 35% on a long-established and entrenched code base? Then join us to hear how Jira developers at Atlassian, the world leader in software collaboration tools, did just that. We will explain how we used Splunk Enterprise to collect metrics as structured events from developer machines to improve our Maven build times for several hundred developers. We aggregated, analyzed, and visualized these events to not only identify and resolve performance bottlenecks as they occurred across our developer pipeline, but also to pinpoint the next big thing to tackle; a dream result for us. Not a Maven user? No worries. The approaches we will cover are good for any developer setup, allowing you to jump start build time improvements while generating the continuous insights you need to do more with less time and less waste. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As customers add more and more data to Splunk, indexer clusters with large volumes of indexers, indexes, and buckets are becoming commonplace. In Splunk labs we run intensive tests to explore the boundaries of the largest indexer clusters. This session will discuss the lifecycle of a Splunk bucket, why it is a key metric in indexer scalability, and which indicators and tunables to monitor in a very large cluster. We&#x27;ll also share how we do performance testing, the latest performance results, and best practices for scaling your Splunk Enterprise cluster to 20 million unique buckets and beyond.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Why Dinosaurs Make Bad Pets: Legacy Monitoring Tools and their Extinction – TIAA Adopts ITSI as their new MoM</comments>
      <description>Too many tools, too many silos between data and collaboration, Outages take too long to Identify Root Cause and There is So Much Noise Abstract:  TIAA had a goal – to replace Legacy Monitoring with an AIOps approach.  What did that mean?  They had to find a better way to break down the silos between data and collaboration and start focusing attention on the right things with the right people.  Monitoring had become about MTTI (mean time to innocence) instead of fixing the fight issues more quickly and finding a way to move from ‘reacting’ to outages to ‘preventing’ them.  ITSI has become the ‘aggregator’ of monitoring data and will help TIAA move from the old Dinosaur Approach of being event driven to the AiOps approach of Service and Priority Driven.  Learn about the Journey, the Lessons Learned, and the Best Practices to Ensure Success.   &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>You replaced IBM QRadar with Splunk Enterprise Security. Now What?</comments>
      <description>Never used Splunk before, have no Splunk admins and you’ve just bought Splunk Enterprise Security? That was us, and now we&#x27;re using Splunk in ways that we could&#x27;ve only dreamed of using IBM QRadar. In this session we’ll share our implementation story, how we worked with Splunk to accelerate our learning curve, and how we went from 0 to 3TB in 3 months with no Splunk admins. We&#x27;ll also cover how Splunk allows us to onboard data sources that we couldn&#x27;t with QRadar. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Does your small team also run a full-featured SOC that supports a global company? In this session we’ll show you how we’ve used Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security to bring together all the relevant security intelligence from our technology stack, transforming our security operations from ad hoc and tactical to strategic and compliance-driven. We’ll discuss key takeaways from our journey, such as the benefits of ingesting data properly from the outset so you can reap the rewards as you scale; how we leverage multiple use cases out of single data sources; and how we created easy-to-understand visualizations that convey our firm’s security posture to management.&lt;p/&gt;
