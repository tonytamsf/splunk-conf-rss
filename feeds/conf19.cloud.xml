      <comments>Check-Out SPL Rehab: A new way to debug your searches</comments>
      <description>Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if SPL had a debug mode?! We think so too, which is why we created SPL Rehab. This new app allows you to step through your search on a per-command basis, visualize key figures from the job inspector and search log, and show you how your overall output is affected! We will also show you how the tool works under the covers and how you can apply some useful dashboarding tricks to your own apps!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>How do I get data into Splunk? What is a sourcetype? Does Splunk already know how to handle my data? What app do I use? What if all my data is syslog? If you are asking these questions, then this session is for you. After all, data quality is the foundation of becoming a data-driven organization. This session will walk through onboarding fundamentals. We will discuss the importance of a timestamp and what to do if your data may not have one. We will explain when to use an existing or create a new sourcetype. We will review the process of examining an app from Splunkbase and determining what sourcetype the app expects. By the end of this session you will no longer use syslog as a sourcetype, but as a means of collecting data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>This session provides detailed guidance on how to use the new dashboard framework into Splunk apps. It first goes over the basic get started tutorial, which helps developers to build a dashboard in just a few minutes. Then it dives deep into the overall architecture, technology stacks, and individual components that can be customized, including layouts, visualizations, data sources, inputs, event handlers. By attending this session, Splunk app developers will be able to integrate dashboards into the apps flexibly and reliably. This session will also walk through the best practices that can help developers to build the optimal dashboards. This session is targeted to both new Splunk app developers and existing Splunk app developers. For people who already know about the existing Splunk technology stack such as Backbone, SimpleXML, SplunkJS, this session will also go through how to migrate to the new framework. As a bonus, this session will also talk about how to export dashboards as beautiful images and PDFs that 100% matches the original ones! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As organizations look to extend Splunk to new datasets for business process insights, it is crucial to have the right data to work with. However Splunk teams can get stuck demonstrating the value of new solutions without having data available. Some very intelligent approaches to data sampling, data preparation, and query optimization can dramatically accelerate your ability to create value from more data.  In this session, you will learn some of these techniques so you can quickly make a business case and demonstrate the value for Splunk Business Flow in your organization.&lt;p/&gt;

As organizations look to extend Splunk to new datasets for business process insights, it is crucial to have the right data to work with. However Splunk teams can get stuck demonstrating the value of new solutions without having data available. Some very intelligent approaches to data sampling, data preparation, and query optimization can dramatically accelerate your ability to create value from more data.  In this session, you will learn some of these techniques so you can quickly make a business case and demonstrate the value for Splunk Business Flow in your organization.

      <description>Wouldn’t it be a great if we had Splunk’s version of Moneyball; an application where everyone comes out ahead by leveraging data to drive effective Splunk enablement and adoption? Splunk’s internal logs have a wealth of information about how Splunk is being used within your organization. Let’s take drinking the “Splunk Champagne” to the next level by applying statistics and machine learning to Splunk’s internal logs! This session will cover segmenting users based on their search profiles - number of searches run, average response times, and recency of searches executed, among other criteria. We’ll use techniques such as clustering to classify users from novice to experts, and use TF-IDF and text analytics techniques to understand commands used in search strings. Enriching this data with completed and planned Splunk Education courses, lunch &amp; learn sessions, and other training activities will enable your users to achieve the Splunk Ninja status they’re looking for! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>So, you have Splunk in your enterprise but people aren&#x27;t using it. What do you do? After working with many organizations in financial services, we have heard the response &quot;yes, we use Splunk.&quot; However, there is a large gap between the organizations that have a Splunk license and those that are truly using Splunk. What is the key to successful adoption of Splunk as an enterprise tool? In this session hear how FIS has driven an uptake\in Splunk adoption across multiple business lines and external clients. Using Splunk, FIS have supported off-prescription solutions including system parameter inquiry, operator fraud, financial invoicing, client conference data analytics, staff resource allocations, and status reporting.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>“Excuse Me! Your Microphone isn’t on” – supporting 400 teaching spaces with Splunk &amp; ITSI – A case study</comments>
      <description>Do you remember the time when you had to attend lectures in person? Monash University has extended teaching hours and stopped repeating lectures. To provide flexibility to students and release pressure on finite campus facilities, lectures are now live streamed and are guaranteed to cover 100% of the classroom content. We are using Splunk and IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) to help monitor live streaming of lectures. It is impossible to manually monitor hundreds of teaching spaces in real-time and keep track of lecture schedules, the status of AV devices, microphones, and audio signals. Come and see how we at Monash University use Splunk ITSI glass tables to rule them all! Using ITSI we get real-time insights into service health and entity-level alerting based on ITSI thresholds.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Exploratory Data Analysis on Aviation Safety Data</comments>
      <description>It’s a bird, it’s a plane. Yes, it’s a plane! Let’s go for a flight into the skies of aviation data and the concepts and tools that make aviation data analytics easy. I’ve been capturing this open data for nearly two years, and I’ve been able to unravel some insights based on four projects. Two projects focus on processing Canadian/U.S. safety reports, while the other two are processing data captured and logged from a radio receiver made from a Raspberry Pi. Data Science is offering very exciting careers and providing an important competitive differentiator, which is why we’ll be reviewing several statistical processing techniques made possible by the power of the Machine Learning Toolkit. We also will cover exploratory data analysis tools built into the Search Processing Language. Before we approach for landing, we’ll show everything under the hood so that everybody can understand the things that make it fly. This is both a technical deep dive as-well-as a practical usage walkthrough.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>To secure the modern endpoint, you need sufficient data, the right visibility and analysis, and the technology necesary to stop an intrusion. We will leverage BOTSv4 data in this session to help you test and validate Splunk use cases related to hunting threats using endpoint data. We’ll cover several real world case studies as described in MITRE ATT&amp;CK™, and we will simulate adversary groups by executing a single Atomic test and building an elaborate chain reaction. We will then show you in Splunk how to confirm your data quality and confirm you have what you need to detect and evict an adversary from your environment. We will demonstrate practical hunt techniques using BOTSv4 data and how to raise the flag when data is missing or is not required.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>What is Splunk Cloud Platform (SCP), and how can it be leveraged in new ways current Splunk Cloud cannot? In this session you&#x27;ll learn what Splunk Cloud Platform has to offer, the core concepts to be successful, and how to use Splunk Developer Cloud (SDC) tools to explore the services and features. Getting started couldn&#x27;t be easier, and we&#x27;ll show you how to go from sign-up to running in just a few clicks. You&#x27;ll be dropped right in the middle of Splunk Investigate where you can access the services and features SCP has to offer (like ingest and search and collaboration tools). But that&#x27;s not all, because using SDC tools you&#x27;ll see how easy it is to create your own app to utilize the same SCP features as Splunk Investigate for your own use cases. Come join us for this end-to-end look at Splunk Cloud Platform, and get your head into the clouds!   &lt;p/&gt;

Coming from a Humanities background, I tend to look at data a little differently than most engineers and data scientists.

      <comments>How Splunkbase identifies, resolves, and reviews incidents using Splunk&gt;Investigate.</comments>
      <description>As a service that has many different integration points, Splunkbase needs to ensure as much uptime as possible. This means that when an incident occurs the root cause needs to be identified, resolved, reviewed and communicated to all relevant parties in a timely manner. Fortunately, Splunk&gt;Investigate has served us very well in achieving these objectives. In this session, we’ll demonstrate how the use of the Splunk&gt;Investigate app on Splunk Cloud Platform (SCP) enables teams to access the same data pool with appropriate authorization to collaborate using shared workbooks. This workflow enables teams to quickly reach a solution when an incident occurs.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>At Splunk, we listen to our data for insights on how to improve our products and provide better services for our customers. We collect aggregated product usage, configuration and performance data from customers who share this information, and use it for benchmarking product performance and building more realistic test environments, developing sizing calculators and best practice configuration guidelines, prioritizing what products and features to develop on various platforms, improving user experience and workflows, and more proactively support our customers. Come hear from a panel of Splunkers about how they have been able to deliver valuable outcomes using telemetry data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How we understand your intent &gt; Splunk Natural Language Platform (NLP)</comments>
      <description>Understanding the intent of a natural language search is a major component of any natural language processing system. Although there are numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex problems in natural language processing, such as understanding intent also known as natural language understanding, very few of them discuss the challenges in production. In this session we take you on a journey from development to production of natural language understanding component of Splunk Natural Language Platform. We will discuss several engineering and data science challenges, and also provide holistic approaches to overcome those challenges. Attendees of the session should walk away with a deeper understanding of different state-of-the-art techniques, such as understanding the intent of a natural language search query, that can help them build their own applications in the natural language processing domain. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>More than 200,000 military service members return to civilian life each year in the United States alone, with many thousands more around the globe. Many are looking to build on their experiences, leveraging the technical training and skills acquired while working in the service to their country. Thousands more are looking to change direction. Both paths can lead to the Splunk community, where we have provided access to free training for thousands of veterans through our customers, partners, and more. Join us for a discussion with some of our leading partners, including the Wounded Warrior Project, WithYouWithMe Academy, and Npower, about how veterans can navigate the transition to technology careers with help from a growing network of partners, and how Splunk can provide new and exciting career opportunities.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Just a normal day in the office – Data driven business process improvements for a global supply chain company.</comments>
      <description>“Our IT-powered business processes are too slow.” Does this sound familiar? If so, that is usually the perfect starting point to dig in and start improving them. Unfortunately, specific data that could help with that effort are not available – normally. In this session we will show you how we at Arvato Supply Chain Solutions got the data we needed and used it to improve the collaboration between IT and business. You will learn how we connected different IT systems such as SAP and conveyor line to Splunk Cloud, and how this helped us to analyze business processes with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI). And, as the icing on the cake, we give you a sneak peak of the machine learning algorithm we implemented to continuously improve our business processes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Kubernetes Observability with Splunk Connect for Kubernetes (SCK)</comments>
      <description>Kubernetes is the go-to standard for the automation of deployment, management and scaling of containerized applications. From an observability perspective it is extremely difficult to analyze, troubleshoot and gain actionable insights from these containerized applications. We bridge this gap of observability with the open-sourced Splunk Connect for Kubernetes. Splunk Connect for Kubernetes is the Splunk supported integration to ingest logs, metrics and Kubernetes object state information into Splunk. This session is intended for k8s users and developers who want to make their lives easier leveraging Splunk alongside Kubernetes. Come join the developers who built Splunk Connect for Kubernetes and learn how to configure and run Splunk to monitor your Kubernetes environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>“There’s always a tension between one’s individual self—one’s million data points—and the statistical breakdown of your existence. It’s the awareness of this tension that I navigate each day.” I wrote this in response to the reveal that black employee representation across Splunk’s U.S. offices was only 3%. #RepresentationMatters and having a “seat at the table” are critical frameworks and tactics to improve diversity, and this panel discussion brings together a diverse cross-section of Splunkers to further explore these topics. Specifically, panel participants will use there statistical data points (e.g., 3%) as a foil to reflect on how they’ve leveraged their individual motivations to push for and create change within their particular role. We intend for the audience to leave stirred by the ideas this conversation will open up, and moved to ask themselves what they can do to create change or elevate others who’ve been underrepresented in their workplace.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Measure What Matters to Streamline Security Operations with Splunk</comments>
      <description>To tame an event queue that&#x27;s ballooning out of control, you need to know first which rules and data sources are generating a disproportionate number of alerts, and second the security value you&#x27;re getting from those rules and data sources. Any changes made to rules or telemetry analyzed without that knowledge risk making your organization more vulnerable. In this session we&#x27;ll discuss how Splunk empowers us to perform advanced analytics on everything from alert conversion rates to human time expenditure on alerts so that we can optimize all processes related to alerting. As long as we know what to measure and where to look, Splunk can help us tune our security operations centers to reduce monotony and false positives without diminishing our ability to detect actual threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Curious about how to efficiently onboard and analyze metric data in Splunk? This talk will teach you the basic design and best practices for Splunk&#x27;s Metric Indexes. Since they were introduced two years ago, Splunk&#x27;s metric capabilities have quickly evolved. Now there is support for rollups, richer logs-to-metrics conversion capabilities, and a more efficient data representation formats. We also will discuss planned future enhancements and how you may best prepare for them today.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Next Generation Data Ingestion and Preparation with Splunk</comments>
      <description>You think data ingestion into Splunk is cumbersome today? Don’t enjoy writing Technology Add-ons (TA) for specific use cases? Then this talk is for you!  We will walk through data ingestion using the data sources supported by the new Splunk Investigate wizard. This allows users of all levels to configure their data source and perform various manipulation functions on the ingested data to make sure it meets their use case. We will also go over the guiding principles of the underlying Data Stream Processing (DSP) pipeline which empowers the user to add their own customizations and send data to a variety of destinations.   We will compare this with current Splunk Enterprise data ingestion process by configuring a TA for a specific use case and then alter the ingested data to the desired format before sending it to an index. The user will be able to draw a contrast between the two approaches and see how it does not have to take up to 6 weeks to acquire and prepare data for analytics in Splunk. We hope this session leaves the user excited about data ingestion and prep.    &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In this session, we’ll explore how companies can adapt to multi-cloud environments using Google Cloud Anthos and Splunk Enterprise to maintain end-to-end visibility into these hybrid workloads. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) On-Prem part of Anthos brings the efficiency, speed, and scale of cloud to manage Kubernetes clusters in your datacenter. Combined with Splunk Connect for Kubernetes, we’ll show you how you get a single pane of glass to manage, monitor &amp; secure your Kubernetes clusters across your organization. We’ll also do a deep dive on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) security controls and how to export security findings from Cloud Security Command Center and cloud asset changes from Cloud Asset Inventory all into Splunk Enterprise for further forensic analysis, to accelerate incident resolution and ensure compliance.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you want to be an ally but don&#x27;t know where or how to start? Diversity and inclusion in technology workplaces is not a women’s issue, or an issue relevant only to other underrepresented groups. Diversity and inclusion are business issues, and they are human issues. We know that businesses profit from the many benefits that diverse perspectives bring to innovation and company competitiveness. In this panel discussion, we aim to facilitate a conversation to better understand the barriers to advocacy, to promote best-practices for effective advocacy, and to enable sharing of first-hand experiences of successful advocacy.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>You knew it had to happen, Splunk is migrating to Python 3! We want this migration to be as painless as possible for apps and scripts developers, but it necessitates some compatibility requirements. This talk will dive into what parts of your apps and scripts will have to become Python 3 compatible. You’ll explore approaches to using Python community supplied backporting libraries as well as Python 2/3 compatible native syntax. By examining common and uncommon gotchas we found while migrating Splunk Enterprise, we will make sure you are prepared to run your code in the future generations of Splunk Enterprise!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>This session will cover how to overcome any missing insights in services and processes in Splunk Cloud. You&#x27;ll learn how to develop alerts and dashboards to show performance and infrastructure health, and an API framework to retrieve data from the cloud infrastructure. We also will show you how to automate retrieval of all entry points to the Splunk on-premises infrastructure, and monitor connections to the intermediate forwarders, deployment servers, HEC and DBX servers, and syslog. In addition, we will address the lack of standardization principles for your on-premises Splunk Infrastructure, how to create gold standard alerts and dashboards, and how to create scripted inputs to gather system information. Finally, we will show you how to address the lack of a centralized view for managing your Splunk deployment server infrastructure, and how to automate the retrieval of deployment clients, server classes, and TA’s from deployment servers and feed the output to Splunk Cloud.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Many Fortune 500 companies use Pivotal Cloud Foundry to push its high-quality code into production faster. While this helps companies enforce enterprise logging and application development standards, the traditional monitoring tools used to monitor development environments become the bottleneck because they are not architected to handle a firehose-nozzle connection. Learn how to use the new Splunk ITSI module for PCF, along with the new version of Splunk Firehose Nozzle for PCF to gain operational insight into PCF platform and increase developer satisfaction.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Take Control of Port 514!: Taming the Syslog Beast</comments>
      <description>Are you frustrated with the task of configuring syslog servers yourself to properly ingest data into Splunk? Take control of the syslog beast once and for all and point your &quot;514&quot; traffic to the new Splunk Connect for Syslog! This new Splunk-supported connector makes quick work of past struggles with syslog servers, sourcetyping, data enrichment, and scale. In this session we will dive into the configuration of the Splunk Connect for Syslog to properly filter, sourcetype, and format your data. We will demonstrate several out-of-the-box examples, highlighting new functionality such as HEC and Kafka transport for resiliency and scale, simple extensions for new device types, and data enrichment that extends far beyond simple sourcetyping of the raw message. Lastly, we will look forward to the integration of syslog with Splunk&#x27;s new Data Stream Processor, and highlight appropriate use cases for each solution. By the time we wrap up, you will know how to tame the syslog beast!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Machine Learning to Unlock the Potential of Your Security Data</comments>
      <description>Vectra customers and security researchers respond to some of the world’s most consequential threats. And they tell us that there’s a consistent set of questions they must answer when investigating any attack scenario.Yet, security data today is broken and unable to effectively answer those questions. It is either incomplete or storage and performance intensive.  Most teams don’t have the information necessary to properly answer the questions required to support their use cases; whether it be for threat hunting, investigations or supporting custom tools and models.In this session, hear about real-world use cases where security teams use machine learning engines to derive unique security attributes and how it is embedded into security workflows.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Too many tools, too many silos between data and collaboration, Outages take too long to Identify Root Cause and There is So Much Noise Abstract:  TIAA had a goal – to replace Legacy Monitoring with an AIOps approach.  What did that mean?  They had to find a better way to break down the silos between data and collaboration and start focusing attention on the right things with the right people.  Monitoring had become about MTTI (mean time to innocence) instead of fixing the fight issues more quickly and finding a way to move from ‘reacting’ to outages to ‘preventing’ them.  ITSI has become the ‘aggregator’ of monitoring data and will help TIAA move from the old Dinosaur Approach of being event driven to the AiOps approach of Service and Priority Driven.  Learn about the Journey, the Lessons Learned, and the Best Practices to Ensure Success.   &lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>Too many tools, too many silos between data and collaboration, Outages take too long to Identify Root Cause and There is So Much Noise Abstract:  TIAA had a goal – to replace Legacy Monitoring with an AIOps approach.  What did that mean?  They had to find a better way to break down the silos between data and collaboration and start focusing attention on the right things with the right people.  Monitoring had become about MTTI (mean time to innocence) instead of fixing the fight issues more quickly and finding a way to move from ‘reacting’ to outages to ‘preventing’ them.  ITSI has become the ‘aggregator’ of monitoring data and will help TIAA move from the old Dinosaur Approach of being event driven to the AiOps approach of Service and Priority Driven.  Learn about the Journey, the Lessons Learned, and the Best Practices to Ensure Success.   </itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>You replaced IBM QRadar with Splunk Enterprise Security. Now What?</comments>
      <description>Never used Splunk before, have no Splunk admins and you’ve just bought Splunk Enterprise Security? That was us, and now we&#x27;re using Splunk in ways that we could&#x27;ve only dreamed of using IBM QRadar. In this session we’ll share our implementation story, how we worked with Splunk to accelerate our learning curve, and how we went from 0 to 3TB in 3 months with no Splunk admins. We&#x27;ll also cover how Splunk allows us to onboard data sources that we couldn&#x27;t with QRadar. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Does your small team also run a full-featured SOC that supports a global company? In this session we’ll show you how we’ve used Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security to bring together all the relevant security intelligence from our technology stack, transforming our security operations from ad hoc and tactical to strategic and compliance-driven. We’ll discuss key takeaways from our journey, such as the benefits of ingesting data properly from the outset so you can reap the rewards as you scale; how we leverage multiple use cases out of single data sources; and how we created easy-to-understand visualizations that convey our firm’s security posture to management.&lt;p/&gt;
