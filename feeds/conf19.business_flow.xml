      <description>As organizations look to extend Splunk to new datasets for business process insights, it is crucial to have the right data to work with. However Splunk teams can get stuck demonstrating the value of new solutions without having data available. Some very intelligent approaches to data sampling, data preparation, and query optimization can dramatically accelerate your ability to create value from more data.  In this session, you will learn some of these techniques so you can quickly make a business case and demonstrate the value for Splunk Business Flow in your organization.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Harnessing the Next Generation of Tech Talent</comments>
      <description>Generation Z is our largest generation ever. They are over 2 billion strong and are predicted to make up nearly 30% of the workforce by 2025. Fifty percent of them are likely to have a university degree that will carry them through 17 jobs, spanning five different careers in their lifetime. So how can we harness the energy of this huge pool of &quot;think differently,&quot; &quot;act differently&quot; resources? With an internship program. Learn how the Splunk ANZ team focused on addressing the staffing challenges many tech companies face, particularly with regard to promoting diversity and including underrepresented groups, such as female students studying STEM subjects. This session will review how they built an internship program that not only delivered huge value to the business, including Gen Z diversity, but also focused on transferring technical and soft skills to facilitate their transition into full-time employment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Monitoring the order fulfilment process within an automated warehouse using Splunk Business Flow</comments>
      <description>Attendees will see how Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow are used to monitor the order fulfilment process within an automated warehouse in real time. You also will see how proactive alerts inform the warehouse that a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is under performing. Then, using process mining to investigate, find the root cause to solve issues before they become problems. This presentation will initially describe the workings of an automated warehouse and the data generated. It then will cover the process of ingesting this data into Splunk and configuring Splunk Business Flow to monitor processes and KPIs. Finally, the session will review the benefits to TGW and its customers from deploying Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow. Come to the session to see how the monitoring, alerting, and process mining functionality in Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Business Flow provides a deep insight into what is happening inside an automated warehouse.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>DATEV provides information services to ~2.5 million payrolling, accounting, and tax clients. Given the sensitivity of the personal and financial data that our clients process, DATAEV decided to establish a SOC to secure our clients&#x27; information, and we put Splunk at the core of its operations. In this session we will discuss four key elements relevant to building a successful SOC with Splunk. We&#x27;ll first discuss how we formed our SOC and orchestrated its activities internally. We&#x27;ll then discuss how we use MITRE&#x27;s ATT&amp;CK™ framework to prioritize activities, how we spread our SOC&#x27;s security knowledge to all relevant groups at DATEV, and how we use Splunk to create real-time situational awareness for different SOC customers, for stakeholders, and for management.&lt;p/&gt;
