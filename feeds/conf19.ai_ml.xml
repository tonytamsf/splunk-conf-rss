      <comments>Accelerate your ability to sniff out application exceptions and detect outliers in performance KPIs</comments>
      <description>Are you frustrated with how long a Splunk time series query of your data can take when you need it now, and are you looking to use machine learning to quickly gain insights about your app’s performance? Finding application exceptions or detecting outliers in your performance KPIs too late can lead your business to suffer without the information it needs to make the right decisions in a timely manner. We will show you how we used the metrics index and machine learning capabilities in Splunk to make better alerts, build scheduled performance reports, and ultimately gain deeper insights and make better decisions based on our data. Sharing these insights as a weekly scheduled report helped our team find hidden issues, increase performance awareness, and maintain SLAs around performance KPIs. Additionally, better alerts operationally helped us to detect outliers in performance metrics within minutes after they occur. Join this session to see queries, demos and several examples for you to take back with you and implement this solution at your company. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Agent Based Modeling for CryptoFinance in Splunk</comments>
      <description>Cryptocurrency ecosystems are highly complex, distributed, and rapidly evolving, rendering many existing financial models ineffective. By aggregating the heterogeneous data streams that are produced by distinct groups within crypto (blockchains, mining pools, exchanges, etc.), we have built a unified analytical platform called Nakamoto Terminal (NTerminal) using Splunk. By leveraging NTerminal, we are creating an adapted agent-based modeling (ABM) system; agents monitor the state of the ecosystem by consuming real time updates from the individual data sources that modulate their state and connectivity. Different heuristic models are called upon to facilitate data transformations and agent interactions. Within this ecosystem, collective agent activity reveals emergent properties and patterns of behavior. With Splunk as the centerpiece, integrated reports, dashboards, or searches allow you to better navigate the ecosystem of interest.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>A healthcare company changing lives with Splunk</comments>
      <description>This session is about a healthcare company born from cybersecurity using Splunk to disrupt the traditional healthcare delivery model. Accuhealth has created a remote patient monitoring platform to analyze health and biometric data collected from IoT devices to improve the patients&#x27; quality of life. A doctor is alerted in real-time of any abnormal changes to their patient&#x27;s vitals and have immediate access to medical trends, allowing the doctor to make faster and more informed decisions. Splunk is at the nerve center of our platform. Using machine learning and health data, the tool provides actionable insights and predictive analysis to patients, doctors, caregivers, and researchers.

      <comments>Building a Security Monitoring Strategy 2.0</comments>
      <description>So you have a SIEM with security data, e.g. firewalls, proxy, endpoint data, etc. Now what? How do you effectively operationalize your investment? This session provides recipes, principles, patterns, and strategies for using Splunk and data-driven analytics to move your security monitoring and compliance effectiveness up the maturity curve. This session will cover how to identify key mixes of data sources, core OOTB content to use, and how to layer capabilities aligned with your maturity. We will help you go beyond the endless alerts and investigations and start creating value by reducing the impact of potential security events. We&#x27;re excited to show you that there&#x27;s no need for a PhD in security assurance and operations—just Splunk and a solid plan.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Building the “smartest factory on planet earth” – Accenture partnering with leading crystal maker innovating with Splunk for Industrial IoT</comments>
      <description>Production of crystal and gemstones requires high-class, top-quality output and unmatched quality and accuracy in the E2E production line. Based on in-depth experience, our joint client is one of the leading providers of production line machinery, serving its own business units as well as industry customers with precision optical instruments, grinding, sawing, drilling, and dressing tools. The new technical innovations in the area of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offer completely new options to improve smart production lines. Thus Accenture is partnering with Splunk on creating a roadmap to build a fully digital, smart factory that will become a world-leading lighthouse facility. This session will provide insights into how the power of data enabled by Splunk can realize a quantum step in modern production line environments. It also will help you understand the value of data science for predictive quality, digital twin scenarios, reduced lot size, and closed loop R&amp;D processes. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>In this session, we tackle data breaches and information exfiltration from cloud file stores. Beyond the attacks that make headlines and result in millions of stolen personal records, we will also focus on the far less publicized risks related to exposure of intellectual property, infrastructure details or finances. We will share our experience in building a defensive strategy that now detects highly-covert exfiltration attempts.To this end, we first shed a lot of light on how companies use general-purpose file stores, such as Box, Office365 or Google Drive. We cover the types of files that commonly get stored in the cloud, file sharing practices, access properties, as well as uses of cloud stores by various departments. There are a lot of unexpected insights which eventually invalidate common security assumptions.As the boundary between good and bad gets blurred, we will provide you with a peek into how to design an effective data-driven defense. This approach helped us hone our detection to just tens of validly suspicious exfiltration files in a massive cloud store.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>&quot;Did we just lose ALL our knowledge objects? Do you know how much time and energy that was?&quot; After a destructive resync, Paychex lost two months of its knowledge object creations/modifications. We learned to be prepared if it were to ever happen again. How? It&#x27;s easier than you might think, and you don&#x27;t have to be an admin. You’ll learn how to proactively save your work (dashboards, reports, data models, MLTK experiments, ITSI glass tables, macros, views, etc.) and audit changes when they occur. You will leave the session knowing how to manage the ever-increasing amount of things you create. You&#x27;ll also have solutions that can save you time and effort from having to recreate lost/modified objects, including how to restore service faster. You also will come away with peace of mind knowing that you can take control of safeguarding and protecting your work, thereby covering your assets when a disaster happens.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Deep Dive: How to use Splunk to protect the environment</comments>
      <description>Can Splunk help eliminate environmental risks and save the company money at the same time? The Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) sets standards defining the amount of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that can be safely released. Honda Manufacturing of Alabama (HMA) must adhere to those standards and track our compliance within the parameters set forth by the ADEM. Failure to comply with these standards will result in potentially damaging the environment and large fines. HMA uses a Regenerative Thermal Oven (RTO) to burn off pollutants from our paint department, which is controlled by an Allen Bradley Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Using this PLC and the sensors built into the RTO, we collect individual chamber temperatures, fan speeds, exhaust temperatures, motor winding temperatures, motor vibrations, and fan vibrations. Using these readings and the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit we try to predict if the temperature will be within the set range. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Malware infection, lateral movement, data exfiltration, oh my! If you’ve spent any time around the wizarding world of security, you know how much effort goes into preventing dark magic from happening. What if you could use machine learning to stay one step ahead of the adversary? Fasten your seatbelts, because in this talk we will show you how Splunk can utilize machine learning models to take your security detections to the next level. We’ll demonstrate how Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit can be used to train, validate, and then deploy models to identify anomalies and discover clusters of bad behavior via user-friendly guided workflows—all this while training your models with more data then you’ve ever been able to before. Prepare to leave Las Vegas equipped to incorporate machine learning in your organization’s security detections and jump from reactive to proactive. Mischief managed! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>When is a 20MB email to an external Gmail account dangerous? It all depends on context. Understanding what normal behavior is will reveal whether specific behavior is malicious or ordinary. We’ll walk you through how using Splunk’s Machine Learning Toolkit and Splunk Enterprise Security together provides actionable insight for analysts to improve security. We&#x27;ll also detail how we caught insider threats in our environment with these tools. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Wouldn’t it be a great if we had Splunk’s version of Moneyball; an application where everyone comes out ahead by leveraging data to drive effective Splunk enablement and adoption? Splunk’s internal logs have a wealth of information about how Splunk is being used within your organization. Let’s take drinking the “Splunk Champagne” to the next level by applying statistics and machine learning to Splunk’s internal logs! This session will cover segmenting users based on their search profiles - number of searches run, average response times, and recency of searches executed, among other criteria. We’ll use techniques such as clustering to classify users from novice to experts, and use TF-IDF and text analytics techniques to understand commands used in search strings. Enriching this data with completed and planned Splunk Education courses, lunch &amp; learn sessions, and other training activities will enable your users to achieve the Splunk Ninja status they’re looking for! &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Is confidence in your ability to disassociate real alerts from noise at an all-time low? Are alerts becoming ineffective because they’re excessive? Many organizations across many industries wrestle with these questions daily. Even so, the prevalence of alert noise persists. Join us to understand how T-Mobile is using Splunk Enterprise with the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit to identify and narrow the point of origin of service-impacting events across our suite of enterprise applications. Using the DensityFunction algorithm to highlight anomalous behavior, we’re able to focus an investigation on a small subset of the applications which in turn leads to faster resolution of the issues we’re confronted with. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>It’s a bird, it’s a plane. Yes, it’s a plane! Let’s go for a flight into the skies of aviation data and the concepts and tools that make aviation data analytics easy. I’ve been capturing this open data for nearly two years, and I’ve been able to unravel some insights based on four projects. Two projects focus on processing Canadian/U.S. safety reports, while the other two are processing data captured and logged from a radio receiver made from a Raspberry Pi. Data Science is offering very exciting careers and providing an important competitive differentiator, which is why we’ll be reviewing several statistical processing techniques made possible by the power of the Machine Learning Toolkit. We also will cover exploratory data analysis tools built into the Search Processing Language. Before we approach for landing, we’ll show everything under the hood so that everybody can understand the things that make it fly. This is both a technical deep dive as-well-as a practical usage walkthrough.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Forecasting Disk Usage with Machine Learning – So easy, even a cave-person can do it!</comments>
      <description>This presentation will walk users through how to use the machine learning toolkit to accurately forecast disk usage across their entire environment, giving them the exact day, month, and year when a server will run out of disk space. No more being awakened at 3:00 am for a bridge call due to a drive running out of disk. This process also can be used by capacity planning teams to select a future date and get a clear view of capacity across the business for all servers. Using machine learning to remove tech debt in an organization does not require a data scientist. You can do it if you have the right server metrics and the MLTK installed. &lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>This presentation will walk users through how to use the machine learning toolkit to accurately forecast disk usage across their entire environment, giving them the exact day, month, and year when a server will run out of disk space. No more being awakened at 3:00 am for a bridge call due to a drive running out of disk. This process also can be used by capacity planning teams to select a future date and get a clear view of capacity across the business for all servers. Using machine learning to remove tech debt in an organization does not require a data scientist. You can do it if you have the right server metrics and the MLTK installed. </itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Health Insights in One-click with New Splunk Monitoring Tools</comments>
      <description>Wouldn’t it be great if you can just be proactively told when your Splunk deployment needs your attention? Wouldn’t it be simply awesome to go to one place and know exactly what the problem is and how to resolve it? At Splunk we understand that every organization suffers the pain of throwing resources to keep the lights on for their infrastructure environment. Fortunately the new version of Splunk Monitoring helps you know when things are not performing as expected. You can now see health of deployment wide without affecting your search or indexing latency and go through guided set of checks curated from years of support experience to solve issues first hand. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Are your analysts spending too much time clearing through notable events? Ours were too, but today our analysts are living the dream: they have all the details they want right there on the Incident Review screen, all while our alerts fine-tune themselves (with workflow action human input). Come and see how we achieved Incident Review Screen 2.0. by using Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit to transition to smarter correlation searches. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Why should running a business feel any different than throwing a party? To demonstrate how Splunk can be used to monitor and manage business operations, the DATA Mavericks team at Acceleris has iteratively perfected its Party Dashboard. It started out as a gimmick at the inauguration party of the company&#x27;s new headquarters, but now the Party Dashboard demonstrates how Splunk’s dashboarding helps any team get real-time visibility into any operation. Join this session to learn why they chose the relevant metrics, how they collected and fed the data to Splunk, and what meaningful insights were generated as a fun introductory example of using Splunk to get visibility into your business operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Is it Normal or Suspicious? Detecting Anomalies via Market Basket Analysis</comments>
      <description>Detecting abnormal behavior is an important objective in security monitoring, but is extremely challenging as we mostly are expected to detect &quot;unknown unknowns.&quot; We can, however, use an entity&#x27;s past behavior to measure how much of what we observe today deviates from normal behavior. In this way we can detect unknown, hidden and insider threats early on to stay ahead of advanced threats. This talk presents a unified, scalable framework for anomaly detection that is built on the frequent itemset mining technique. The premise is that if we can align an event with more frequent patterns observed in history, then the event is unlikely to be an anomaly. By mining through an extensive set of features and feature co-occurrences, the model can accurately capture the normal behaviors. Any new behaviors can then be scored. At which point, any new rare co-occurrences of events can be detected and sent to analysts and SOC teams for rapid investigation.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>“Our IT-powered business processes are too slow.” Does this sound familiar? If so, that is usually the perfect starting point to dig in and start improving them. Unfortunately, specific data that could help with that effort are not available – normally. In this session we will show you how we at Arvato Supply Chain Solutions got the data we needed and used it to improve the collaboration between IT and business. You will learn how we connected different IT systems such as SAP and conveyor line to Splunk Cloud, and how this helped us to analyze business processes with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI). And, as the icing on the cake, we give you a sneak peak of the machine learning algorithm we implemented to continuously improve our business processes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Threat hunting is hard, and threat hunting in an enterprise network with thousands of endpoints is even harder. We will demonstrate how we leveraged Splunk Enterprise to build an Advanced Threat Hunting platform designed for large scale threat hunting of 100,000 or more endpoints. Using Splunk Enterprise allows us to combine analytics, data enrichment, and custom workflows to display in one platform the most important data to analysts. Our threat hunting platform addresses the challenges of data retention and collection, high false positive rates, and analyst fatigue, all while lowering the time to detection of malicious incidents and improving the efficiency of enterprise SOC operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Lessons Learned From Building a Threat Detection Program</comments>
      <description>We will share experiences and best practices for implementing notable events, the various Splunk Enterprise Security frameworks, and adaptive response actions, and we&#x27;ll share our approach for building a program to consistently develop, measure, and iterate on correlation searches. We will discuss how to integrate lessons learned from incidents, red team engagements, threat intelligence, threat hunting, and requirements from business units into the program. Example tactics we&#x27;ll cover include leveraging low-fidelity detections to develop higher-fidelity and higher-value ones, managing detection content simply and easily through macros, and building a formula to assess the efficacy of your detection content. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Lessons Learned from Deploying Splunk UBA</comments>
      <description>Splunk User Behavioral Analytics (UBA) is a machine learning driven solution that helps organizations find hidden threats and anomalous behavior across users, devices, and applications. In this session we&#x27;ll answer questions that came up during our large-scale deployment such as, once you&#x27;ve got UBA installed, how do you know if it is working well in your environment? And how long after installation does it take for the system to be operational and produce results? We&#x27;ll also share best practices for validating outputs and tuning the system. This session will help you jumpstart your understanding of UBA and help you get your UBA deployment into production and detecting threats faster. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Los Angeles World Airports - Streamlining event management with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI)</comments>
      <description>Los Angeles World Airport has chosen Splunk&#x27;s ITSI as their centralized event/alert management platform. We’ve consolidated alerts/events from multiple management platforms across the enterprise, reducing help desk churn by grouping similar events, and evaluating the results against smart Key Performance Indicator (KPI) thresholds so that only actionable alerts or events are processed. In addition, we’ve broken down the legacy data siloes through the use of service definitions, glass tables, and deep-dives, providing better insight for all team members. Lastly, we’ve automated ITSI service and dependency creation via the Splunk ServiceNow bi-direction integration App. Plan top attend this session and you will learn how we’ve increased visibility (making data available for everyone); increased efficiency by reducing alert/event noise; improved resolution using ITSI Smart KPIs; and implemented auto service creation via ServiceNow &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Blockchain scalability is one of the main barriers to adoption of this revolutionary new technology. Finance, supply chain, and e-commerce blockchain deployments often have peak throughputs that far exceed their baseline. For example, when tickets for a popular concert go on sale, the peak transaction throughput will result in unacceptable latency for the users. Samsung SDS Accelerator is a layer 2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric that enables up to 10x transaction throughput during this burst of activity. Using Splunk MLTK, we’re able to detect and react to these bursts of activity without compromising the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Measure What Matters to Streamline Security Operations with Splunk</comments>
      <description>To tame an event queue that&#x27;s ballooning out of control, you need to know first which rules and data sources are generating a disproportionate number of alerts, and second the security value you&#x27;re getting from those rules and data sources. Any changes made to rules or telemetry analyzed without that knowledge risk making your organization more vulnerable. In this session we&#x27;ll discuss how Splunk empowers us to perform advanced analytics on everything from alert conversion rates to human time expenditure on alerts so that we can optimize all processes related to alerting. As long as we know what to measure and where to look, Splunk can help us tune our security operations centers to reduce monotony and false positives without diminishing our ability to detect actual threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you want to predict an outage before it happens? Are you wondering how to pursue the incremental journey to Artificial Intelligence Operations (AIOps)? This case study will reveal a real-world use case from T-Mobile USA and show you how to predict cell tower congestion in advance using Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit. In the age of binge watching on cell phones and wireless broadband services, cell congestion reduces speed and reliability and results in buffered video streaming and/or dropped calls that dents the use of services and the revenue. Building forecasting models for congestion requires correlation of several parameters including seasonal variations. Doing this on a large scale in real time takes significant resources. In this session, attendees will learn about the journey to build this predictive capability, including data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, benefits, and lessons learned. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Saving the Nation’s Food Supply with Data-Driven Analytics</comments>
      <description>Copper River ES, a strategic partner for Splunk public sector, is working with a large federal agency that has restructured their NOC and SOC organizations into a single unified entity as part of operational optimization.  The agency is responsible for protecting IP and other assets totaling $4.3 trillion as part of safeguarding the nation’s food supply chain.   The goal was to enhance the ability to handle problem escalations quickly and improve communications between teams. They are currently ingesting more than 3TB daily across 65 data sources where Splunk is leveraged as an integrated data platform and framework service to act as a nerve center for the combined NOC and SOC teams. Implementation has resulted in dramatically reducing MTTD to an average of less than 30 min compared to previous times of up to 12 hours, MTTR times from 16 hours to often less than 1 with overall outage times having now been reduced by about 68%. From a security perspective, it is used to identify data exfiltration and insider threats, as well as for security operations and compliance.  Increasing visibility into all aspects of system operations and troubleshooting efforts is now supported through a series of custom Splunk App’s, glass tables, reports and alerts with operational guides and training to best leverage the capabilities Splunk has generated.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know. With vast amounts of cloud data coming in at cloud-speed, it can be difficult to see through the noise and know what to look for. Are malicious adversaries attempting to comprise the environment? Is my environment under- or over-provisioned? Do I have an insider possibly exfiltrating company data? Are employees actually using the services? What is all of this costing per service, department, business unit? Don&#x27;t worry, we will help you figure all this out in a prescriptive manner by showcasing these and other use cases. Then, we will show you the &quot;how&quot; by exposing the searches, the data needed, and showing you how to onboard that data. You will walk away with use cases that can be implemented immediately in your own environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <itunes:subtitle>Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know. With vast amounts of cloud data coming in at cloud-speed, it can be difficult to see through the noise and know what to look for. Are malicious adversaries attempting to comprise the environment? Is my environment under- or over-provisioned? Do I have an insider possibly exfiltrating company data? Are employees actually using the services? What is all of this costing per service, department, business unit? Don&#x27;t worry, we will help you figure all this out in a prescriptive manner by showcasing these and other use cases.

      <comments>Splunking Crime Part II - Analysing Bias in Police Actions</comments>
      <description>Last year at .conf18 we used Splunk and Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to analyze and predict the crime in London. This year we are taking a step forward and analyzing the bias in the police actions in the U.K. We will use police, population, religion, and race data to understand how police use their powers in different areas on people from different racial backgrounds. We will use open data sources and index them in Splunk. Using advanced visualizations we will analyze the data and understand more about police actions. Then using MLTK we will create a predictive model for crimes and then analyze the model for any bias due to the data provided. Machine bias is a real issue nowadays when machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used by government agencies to predict crime and even pass sentences on convicts. We need to understand that along with having positive impact of predicting crime, it can have a long-lasting negative impact as well.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you want to rely on manual intervention to fix your application if something goes wrong? In this deep-dive session you will learn how Priceline uses machine learning to find outliers and anomalies in various data sets, including but not limited to bookings, search patterns, changes in logging patterns, etc. You will learn how we used machine learning combined with predictive analytics to solve variety of use cases. For example, we collect Kafka offset data, which is sending data to their respective syncs. We also monitor to see if the traffic is receded or data consumption has increased or decreased unexpectedly. We will show how different stages of application states are controlled with the use of data and alerts, like disabling the app and enabling it according to the data. We also will show you how Priceline deals with brownouts, the gradual degradation of volumes by using machine learning over long periods, using different self healing techniques and custom apps. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Maturing and scaling your security operations rests on your ability to process and analyze huge volumes of often unrelated data in real time. But today&#x27;s tools notoriously overwhelm SOC analysts with the sheer number of alerts and high percent of false positives, resulting in confusion about what tools to use for investigation and response. In this session, members of Splunk&#x27;s Security Research Team will discuss the next generation of Enterprise Security Content Updates that they developed, which integrate the entire Splunk for Security product suite to create a robust end-to-end defense—detection, investigation, and response. We will go over how to use these security guides, which will leverage Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Splunk User Behavior Analytics. We&#x27;ll also highlight the Run Story feature we built to operationalize ESCU Analytics stories and share tools and techniques customers can use to write and test their own use cases.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Teaching Splunk to Hear: Audio Spectrum Analysis in Splunk for Event Classification and Anomaly Detection</comments>
      <description>If we hear a nearby gunshot, we instinctively react. A mechanic often knows their machine&#x27;s sound so well that they can diagnose issues by sound alone. While machines can be given analytical capabilities with machine learning (ML), sensing human inputs - like auditory or other sensory data - in a form that machines can understand is challenging. In Splunk, we have been all about making machine data accessible to humans, but what if we flip that and make human data accessible to machines? I take audio captured from live and recorded sources and using Fast Fourier transform feed it into Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) for classification and anomaly detection. Can we use Splunk to detect gunshots? Can we learn a machine’s normal sounds to detect pending failures? This presentation uses Splunk to apply superhuman ML detection and learning capabilities to human data to show that the MLTK contains accessible tools you can apply to your IT and security problems. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>This presentation will discuss how Security Operation Centers (SOCs) will need to change to meet the cybersecurity challenges of the 2020s. The speaker will draw on his experience as a founder of the first SOC-as-a-Service company that delivers managed security services using Splunk. Most industry analysts envision that the next generation of SOCs will leverage AI, Big Data, and the Cloud, but how far can automation take us and is the concept of an autonomous SOC really practical? How will the SOC of the Future address the global shortage of cyber professionals? How will the role of security analysts need to change? Will the SOC of the Future still need to be housed in dedicated physical facilities? The speaker will provide a blueprint of Proficio’s vision of the SOC of the Future using Splunk and provide a playbook for IT leaders and aspiring IT leaders on how to drive continuous improvement in productivity and measurable outcomes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Tired of relying on static threshold-based alerts that don’t seem to provide much value? Do you typically end up finding outliers in your data by staring at lines on your dashboards? We are told machine learning is going make alerts and dashboards smarter, but how? We will help demystify machine learning and provide a practical guide to apply machine learning techniques for numeric outlier detection, and forecasting to make alerts and dashboards smarter and easier to use for actionable results. We will show you the basics of how you can understand your data, get them ready for machine learning, and get the machine to start working for you! You will leave the session beginning to think like a data scientist and knowing how to apply purpose-driven machine learning to your searches in Splunk! &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>User Experience Modeling with the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit</comments>
      <description>Paychex’s goal of providing the best user experience for our clients has led to a significant investment in performance testing and monitoring of our applications. Currently all Paychex applications record the execution time for every task and subtask to logs. These are indexed by Splunk, allowing us to identifying areas where changes to code and database queries will have a positive impact on the overall user experience. This presentation will focus on combining this user experience data with client demographic data (such as the number of active employees) and using the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit to build predictive models of user experience based on client demographic data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Use Splunk SIEMulator to Generate Data for Automated Detection, Investigation, and Response </comments>
      <description>Obtaining data to develop defenses against threats is a constant challenge for security analysts. To that end, Splunk&#x27;s Security Research team developed the Splunk SIEMulator, a framework modeled after Chris Long&#x27;s DetectionLab that allows a defender to replay attack scenarios using AttackIQ in a simulated environment. SIEMulator’s Attack Range environments are all configured with Splunk forwarders and the apps necessary to create and store data in CIM data models. We&#x27;ll show you how to use the SIEMulator to produce shareable data that can help security analysts replicate scenarios and effectively detect, investigate, and respond to threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Machine Learning to Detect Traffic Anomalies</comments>
      <description>Finding anomalies in network data is no easy task, especially when you have terabytes of logs per day to analyze. But have no fear, we’re going to teach you how. In this session we will perform a technical deep dive into how a global content delivery network provider is using Splunk’s Machine Learning Toolkit to discover anomalies in network traffic. We’ll take you on a data science journey and show you how we tested multiple anomaly detection techniques, overcame challenges, fine-tuned detections, and ultimately arrived at meaningful alerts based on machine learning.&lt;p/&gt;
