      <description>Would you be able to detect a sophisticated adversary targeting your Kubernetes clusters and workloads tonight? How do busy teams with stacked backlogs find time to learn how to attack Kubernetes clusters, detect those attacks, and build defenses to reduce the attack surface? We will demonstrate an effective purple team methodology that &quot;uses every part of the buffalo&quot; by 1) executing attacks on Kubernetes using the open source tool Peirates, 2) tracking the attack artifacts from the adversary simulation in Splunk, 3) teaching the defenders how the attack was performed and where to look for forensic artifacts, and 4) working together in the purple-est way possible to improve detection and response capabilities using Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Peirates.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>ATT&amp;CK™ Yourself Before Someone Else Does</comments>
      <description>Do you love the idea of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, but you’re not sure how to use it in your Splunk-centric security program? This talk will teach you practical ways to use the framework in your own organization and the Splunk security tools that will help you do so. We&#x27;ll start the talk by identifying an adversary and some of their known techniques, and then we&#x27;ll show how to choose an appropriate set of detections and how to test whether those detections are working as expected. You&#x27;ll leave the talk better able to take advantage of threat intelligence, cover the right set of ATT&amp;CK™ tactics and adversary groups, and eliminate organizational blind spots.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you want to use machine learning to enhance your datacenter security monitoring, but you don’t know where to start? Then this is the talk for you. Come learn how high secure datacenter operations benefit from operationalizing machine learning. With the help of the Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit, your security analysts can take different approaches to use case creation and gain new insight into what&#x27;s going on in your environment. We&#x27;ll detail the challenges, benefits and use cases of using machine learning for datacenter security monitoring, and we&#x27;ll answer questions such as: Where does it make sense to apply machine learning, and where should we stick with classic searches? Can we detect meaningful anomalies in system behavior? Is it possible to cluster our account activities and find unusual patterns? This is a practical session of security monitoring use cases, deep diving into the ideas, concepts and the SPL behind them.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Alerts in cloud environments require your team to quickly and precisely gather evidence and isolate affected environments. The GE Digital Predix Incident Response (IR) team found an abundance of content for analyzing forensic evidence from Windows environments, but they noticed a gap in content built for performing investigations on Linux-based hosts. The Predix IR team will discuss the tools they have built to contain a compromised Linux-based hosts, gather evidence, and analyze that evidence in Splunk. Utilizing splunk searches, lookups, and visualization components to look both narrowly into the data set as well as broadly across the rest of the environmental data in splunk to identify known bad or potentially suspicious activities that may warrant further investigation by an analyst. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Automate Your Phishing Response with Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Machine Learning</comments>
      <description>We developed an automation framework that classifies and mitigates emails reported to the SOC. The framework acts as an engine that consumes multiple data sources, including a supervised machine learning model and a risk scoring algorithm to assess with high confidence if an email is phishing, spam, or benign. We will discuss the benefits of our approach to phishing mitigation, such as enhancing our SOC&#x27;s ability to automatically identify, prioritize, and mitigate malicious phishing attempts against employees before any damage is done.  The session will outline the overall design of the framework, detail the primary components that are used within Splunk Phantom and Splunk Enterprise Security, and will outline the supervised machine learning model that we trained to aide the automation engine.  &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>You&#x27;ve probably heard examples of Splunk Phantom automating 90% of Tier 1 processes, but did you know that Phantom improves human-lead processes too? Come learn about the hidden value of validation and utility playbooks from Penn State University’s Enterprise Security Manager and Splunk’s Lead Technologist for Higher Education. Validation playbooks are automated tests run to validate a human judgement or request. Utility playbooks are short easy-to-create playbooks in Phantom that an analyst  runs during an investigation.  We’ll cover when to use validation and utility playbooks, how to get started creating them, and ideas for other playbooks you can use to improve your daily operations. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>The boss saw Ironman and wanted to create a JARVIS-like assistant for our SOC...so we built him one using Splunk. In this session we will share how we developed a Splunk virtual assistant to improve SOC efficiency and support the SOC 2.0 model of continual improvement. SOC JARVIS solves problems such as: How does a SOC manage its attack detection ideas and knowledge? How does an analyst understand the impact of their search changes on alert volumes? How does the SOC manage feedback between analysts and search authors? Learn how to use Splunk in a novel way to address these problems so that you can make your SOC workflows more efficient and let analysts spend more time threat hunting and improving how they detect attacks.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Build Automated Decisions for Incident Response with Splunk Phantom</comments>
      <description>Incident response (IR) analysts are required to make multiple decisions on every alert and incident. Whether the decision is to escalate, respond, or to discard the alert, each one of those decisions is critical to protecting their environment. With the integration of SOAR platforms like Splunk Phantom into IR teams, many of those decisions can now be automated for analysts. These decisions can save hours of work for analysts and allow for focus on more critical alerts. However, there are still questions to answer before implementing these decisions. What data is needed to make confident decisions? Where in the process should these decisions be made? How can existing decisions be improved? How should new decisions be integrated? The General Electric IR team has worked to answer these questions by using Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Phantom. In this session, we will show how our team approached these questions, implemented solutions, and integrated decisions for our analysts to save time and focus their efforts.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>So you have a SIEM with security data, e.g. firewalls, proxy, endpoint data, etc. Now what? How do you effectively operationalize your investment? This session provides recipes, principles, patterns, and strategies for using Splunk and data-driven analytics to move your security monitoring and compliance effectiveness up the maturity curve. This session will cover how to identify key mixes of data sources, core OOTB content to use, and how to layer capabilities aligned with your maturity. We will help you go beyond the endless alerts and investigations and start creating value by reducing the impact of potential security events. We&#x27;re excited to show you that there&#x27;s no need for a PhD in security assurance and operations—just Splunk and a solid plan.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Advanced attackers that live off your land add insult to what can be very serious injury. In this session we&#x27;ll show you how to use behavioral analysis to identify advanced attackers that evade traditional signature-based detection methods. We do so in our organization by using Splunk to combine insights from traditional data sources to detect activity across multiple phases of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework. We&#x27;ll focus on how to build queries  tune them for your environment, and start catching these threat actors with behavioral detections as soon as you get back from .conf.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Building threat-driven use cases for the real world with iDefense intelligence</comments>
      <description>Where did you come up with the idea for your last use case? Traditional approaches to use case ideation focus on identifying new use cases based on the data already available to the security operations center. However, the threat landscape is constantly changing, and attackers are constantly getting more sophisticated. To detect these advanced threats, our use cases must be based on both business and threat context. In this session, we will share our approach to building innovative use cases based on real-world threats. Starting with industry-specific threat intelligence, we identify the threat actors and their specific tactics, techniques, and procedures. With these insights, we identify use cases relevant to the business, map them to both existing and new data sources, and prioritize implementation based on the specific threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Catch exfiltration from cloud file stores early!</comments>
      <description>In this session, we tackle data breaches and information exfiltration from cloud file stores. Beyond the attacks that make headlines and result in millions of stolen personal records, we will also focus on the far less publicized risks related to exposure of intellectual property, infrastructure details or finances. We will share our experience in building a defensive strategy that now detects highly-covert exfiltration attempts.To this end, we first shed a lot of light on how companies use general-purpose file stores, such as Box, Office365 or Google Drive. We cover the types of files that commonly get stored in the cloud, file sharing practices, access properties, as well as uses of cloud stores by various departments. There are a lot of unexpected insights which eventually invalidate common security assumptions.As the boundary between good and bad gets blurred, we will provide you with a peek into how to design an effective data-driven defense. This approach helped us hone our detection to just tens of validly suspicious exfiltration files in a massive cloud store.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Differentiating Evil from Benign in the Normally Abnormal World</comments>
      <description>Have you ever been positive you had found evil, only to realize it was normal after hours of triage and work? We have all heard and love “KNOW NORMAL FIND EVIL,” but how hard is it to actually know normal? The MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework gives defenders a better map to “find evil,” but how can this framework be used to “know normal”?Rick will discuss how knowing normal in a world of abnormal is harder than one thinks, and how addressing the actual root cause of evil can improve the technology industry as a whole.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Failure to log everything needed for maximum visibility in your environment can leave huge gaps in your ability to remediate threats. But running an enterprise-level logging program can be difficult: how do you know if you&#x27;re logging everything necessary to detect threats? Are all of your technologies configured to send the right logs? Are they all logging to Splunk? In this session we will help you answer these and other critical questions of your logging program, which will ultimately help you remediate issues and better use log analysis to mitigate threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Going beyond basic perimeter defense, Threat Hunting cuts through the noise of endpoint telemetry and anti-virus data to find nation-state level Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) that hide below the alert threshold. We will demonstrate, through 4 hunt analytic use cases, how to overcome the legacy challenge of relying on Packet Capture (PCAP) data to detect adversaries, highlighting the need to transform Hunt operations by combining Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry data with knowledge of APT behavior to find hidden adversaries. This talk will provide a framework for planning and executing hunts, demonstrate why focusing on EDR telemetry data can add additional value over and beyond traditional network data, and how to strengthen hunting through a Purple Team approach.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Finding Evil Is Never An Accident: How to Hunt in BOTS</comments>
      <description>To secure the modern endpoint, you need sufficient data, the right visibility and analysis, and the technology necesary to stop an intrusion. We will leverage BOTSv4 data in this session to help you test and validate Splunk use cases related to hunting threats using endpoint data. We’ll cover several real world case studies as described in MITRE ATT&amp;CK™, and we will simulate adversary groups by executing a single Atomic test and building an elaborate chain reaction. We will then show you in Splunk how to confirm your data quality and confirm you have what you need to detect and evict an adversary from your environment. We will demonstrate practical hunt techniques using BOTSv4 data and how to raise the flag when data is missing or is not required.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Getting Started with Risk-Based Alerting and MITRE</comments>
      <description>Risk-based alerting is gaining traction in the SOC: by using multiple-lower fidelity searches to yield higher-fidelity investigations, it allows analysts to rapidly prioritize investigations, correlate “risk objects” between alerts, identify gaps in monitoring, and generally understand attack narratives. We&#x27;ll discuss the first steps needed to transition from the traditional one-to-one ticket investigation model to this holistic approach, i.e. how risk-based alerting works, a description of prerequisites, and dashboard optimization.  We will also discuss how to start building a comprehensive search inventory based on Splunk analytics, MITRE, and your own threat intelligence.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Have No Fear, WMI Is Here: Identify Lateral Movement and Malicious Backdoors with Windows Management Instrumentation</comments>
      <description>Attackers are increasingly using a &#x27;living off the land&#x27; approach, often using crypto mining malware, EternalBlue, timing, or other attacks that leverage the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line. These attacks typically don&#x27;t generate any events via conventional Sysmon and PowerShell, so even if you&#x27;re pulling in those logs you likely won&#x27;t see them. Join this session to learn how to detect and protect your organization from these advanced WMI-based attacks.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How We Scaled Splunk Enterprise Security to 100TB with Search Head Clustering</comments>
      <description>Want to scale Splunk Enterprise Security to 100TB/day? We&#x27;ve done it! In Splunk labs, we built workloads that closely simulate our customers&#x27; usage patterns, and we scaled beyond a 100TB per day ingest rate with search head clustering. In this session we&#x27;ll share key aspects of our Splunk Enterprise Security workload design: diverse source types, major data models, search scenarios, data enrichment, and hardware choices for search head and indexer.  We will also share how different configurations impact search performance and how to tune Splunk Enterprise Security effectively with parameters such as max_searches_per_cpu, acceleration.max_concurrent, allow_skew, and maxBundleSize to name a few. Come see how we scaled to large volumes while efficiently utilizing hardware capacity for maximum performance.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Hunting in the Dark: Profiling Encrypted Network Traffic</comments>
      <description>It&#x27;s not easy to detect malicious patterns within encrypted network traffic. JA3, a method of fingerprinting Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) traffic developed by SalesForce, aims to address this by profiling client (JA3) and server (JA3s) SSL connections. Since these fingerprints are unique and persistent, they provide a way to discover applications, fingerprint Operating Systems, and even discover malware. This presentation showcases how to use Splunk to streamline JA3 event data gathered from Bro/Zeek, use that in combination with host-level visibility provided by Carbon Black, and ultimately correlate network signatures with endpoint telemetry. You will learn how to use this method to get a better understanding of what processes are causing benign or malicious SSL connections on your network and how to hunt for unknown threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Improve Your Cyber Monitoring &amp; Response Strategy with Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk Phantom</comments>
      <description>How do you know if your alerting and response processes adequately cover the tactics and techniques that your adversaries will use against you? If you&#x27;re not sure, then how do to you continuously improve to adapt to ever-evolving threats? This session will provide practical guidance on leveraging models like the diamond model, MITRE ATT&amp;CK™, and OODA to deconstruct your monitoring and response program so that you can make strategic improvements and mature it on a strong foundation. Using these frameworks will help your team recognize its own bias in developing use cases, understand how its alerting and response coverage maps to adversary tactics/techniques, and develop and prioritize new use cases. The session will wrap up discussing practical tips for creating a continuous improvement program that helps you leverage Splunk Enterprise Security and Splunk Phantom to maintain a strong security posture.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Are your analysts spending too much time clearing through notable events? Ours were too, but today our analysts are living the dream: they have all the details they want right there on the Incident Review screen, all while our alerts fine-tune themselves (with workflow action human input). Come and see how we achieved Incident Review Screen 2.0. by using Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit to transition to smarter correlation searches. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>“You should be looking at Indicators of Compromise!” exclaims your CISO, regulator, vendor, and mom.  No problem, right? You have the most expensive security intelligence vendor and all you have to do is correlate in your expensive SIEM. If you&#x27;ve tried this, then you are laughing with me. Come hear my exploration into implementing IOCs at a major US insurance company and a major US bank. I’ll address the differences between Indicators of Compromise vs Indicators of Attack, and I will show you how not to use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, plus some tips on how it use it well.  My goal is to save you from falling into the same pitfalls when dealing with Indicators of Crap.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Is it Normal or Suspicious? Detecting Anomalies via Market Basket Analysis</comments>
      <description>Detecting abnormal behavior is an important objective in security monitoring, but is extremely challenging as we mostly are expected to detect &quot;unknown unknowns.&quot; We can, however, use an entity&#x27;s past behavior to measure how much of what we observe today deviates from normal behavior. In this way we can detect unknown, hidden and insider threats early on to stay ahead of advanced threats. This talk presents a unified, scalable framework for anomaly detection that is built on the frequent itemset mining technique. The premise is that if we can align an event with more frequent patterns observed in history, then the event is unlikely to be an anomaly. By mining through an extensive set of features and feature co-occurrences, the model can accurately capture the normal behaviors. Any new behaviors can then be scored. At which point, any new rare co-occurrences of events can be detected and sent to analysts and SOC teams for rapid investigation.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk&#x27;s Security Research Team collects attack data in the wild from across the globe and analyzes new and unusual techniques, tactics, and procedures employed by threat actors. We use this data to help customers build tailored defenses—defenses that automatically detect, investigate, and respond to suspicious activities in real time. In this session we will discuss how Splunk security researchers created our own honeypot and data collection framework in response to research demonstrating that honeypots were twice as effective as open-source intelligence feeds at detecting new threats (http://tinyurl.com/y335po8d). We will provide an introduction to honeypots and explain how we architected and built KLAPP-Back, a high-interaction SSH honeypot. We will also discuss how KLAPP-Back helped us build better detection analytics and seed Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Splunk User Behavior Analytics use cases with attacker data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Large Scale Threat Hunting in Splunk</comments>
      <description>Threat hunting is hard, and threat hunting in an enterprise network with thousands of endpoints is even harder. We will demonstrate how we leveraged Splunk Enterprise to build an Advanced Threat Hunting platform designed for large scale threat hunting of 100,000 or more endpoints. Using Splunk Enterprise allows us to combine analytics, data enrichment, and custom workflows to display in one platform the most important data to analysts. Our threat hunting platform addresses the challenges of data retention and collection, high false positive rates, and analyst fatigue, all while lowering the time to detection of malicious incidents and improving the efficiency of enterprise SOC operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>We will share experiences and best practices for implementing notable events, the various Splunk Enterprise Security frameworks, and adaptive response actions, and we&#x27;ll share our approach for building a program to consistently develop, measure, and iterate on correlation searches. We will discuss how to integrate lessons learned from incidents, red team engagements, threat intelligence, threat hunting, and requirements from business units into the program. Example tactics we&#x27;ll cover include leveraging low-fidelity detections to develop higher-fidelity and higher-value ones, managing detection content simply and easily through macros, and building a formula to assess the efficacy of your detection content. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Lessons Learned from Deploying Splunk UBA</comments>
      <description>Splunk User Behavioral Analytics (UBA) is a machine learning driven solution that helps organizations find hidden threats and anomalous behavior across users, devices, and applications. In this session we&#x27;ll answer questions that came up during our large-scale deployment such as, once you&#x27;ve got UBA installed, how do you know if it is working well in your environment? And how long after installation does it take for the system to be operational and produce results? We&#x27;ll also share best practices for validating outputs and tuning the system. This session will help you jumpstart your understanding of UBA and help you get your UBA deployment into production and detecting threats faster. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Security architectures typically involve many layers of tools and products that are not designed to work together, leaving gaps in how security teams bridge multiple domains to coordinate defense. The Splunk Adaptive Operations Framework (AOF) addresses these gaps by connecting security products and technologies from our partners with Splunk security solutions including Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) and Splunk Phantom. Join this session to learn how the Splunk AOF benefits both users and security technology providers by enabling rich context for all security decisions, collaborative decision-making, and orchestrated actions across diverse security technologies. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Measure What Matters to Streamline Security Operations with Splunk</comments>
      <description>To tame an event queue that&#x27;s ballooning out of control, you need to know first which rules and data sources are generating a disproportionate number of alerts, and second the security value you&#x27;re getting from those rules and data sources. Any changes made to rules or telemetry analyzed without that knowledge risk making your organization more vulnerable. In this session we&#x27;ll discuss how Splunk empowers us to perform advanced analytics on everything from alert conversion rates to human time expenditure on alerts so that we can optimize all processes related to alerting. As long as we know what to measure and where to look, Splunk can help us tune our security operations centers to reduce monotony and false positives without diminishing our ability to detect actual threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Modernize and Mature Your SOC with Risk-Based Alerting</comments>
      <description>Today SOCs are in desperate need of a different alerting approach. Texas Instruments (TI) decided to transform its SOC by using risk-based alerting to generate fewer, higher fidelity alerts, and by aligning to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ framework, which provides more situational awareness to analysts. This risk-based approach reduces false positives and the situational numbness associated with the legacy whitelisting process. Splunk and TI will walk you through TI&#x27;s SOC successes as it transitioned to risk-based alerting. TI will detail a few real-life risk-based rule examples, discuss learning curves to fast track your transition, and discuss how MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ fits in with this approach.  After this session, you will have the foundation to embark on your risk-based alerting journey, allowing you to increase detection mechanisms, increase your coverage of the ATT&amp;CK™ techniques, and improve the overall effectiveness of your SOC.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Protecting your Data: The 2020 Decennial Census and Data Security</comments>
      <description>The Census is the nation’s largest peacetime mobilization effort and determines congressional representation. Census data is used by businesses, governments and civic organizations to inform decision-making and this year the Census is going mobile and online for the first time. This means that security is a top priority in ensuring the success of the 2020 Decennial. This segment of the conference will explore security related topics to include vulnerabilities, scalability and performance, with a special focus on Data Privacy, Compliance and Reputational Threat Management. If all things data and IT Security excite you, then this session is for you. Census executives Atri Kalluri and Zack Schwartz will provide a behind the scenes overview of the systems supporting the 2020 Decennial, including Splunk, and real world case studies on how the Census Bureau is adopting best practices across IT security and social media monitoring to ensure the security of respondent data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Scary (Spooky?) Fast Intelligence-Based Hunting with Splunk Phantom</comments>
      <description>Organizations today struggle with quickly and consistently applying behavior-based threat intelligence across their security tools. The hours needed to stitch together this information manually leave analysts unprepared to quickly turnaround questions from management about their vulnerability to threats that their management sees in the news. In this session we will demonstrate how to use Splunk Phantom to reduce that time lag by automating your threat hunts. Specifically, we will show you how to use Yet Another Recursive Algorithm (YARA) rules on endpoint and network security tools automatically and simultaneously. We will use a case study to show the benefits achieved from this playbook: better reporting, more robust procedures, faster time to detect malware variants, and generally more efficient and effective threat hunts.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Securing the Intelligent Enterprise with SAP Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk</comments>
      <description>Looking to eliminate blind spots across your SAP environment and take proactive action to detect and mitigate attacks before mission-critical ERP applications are compromised? SAP recently teamed with Splunk to help a leading manufacturer build and validate a first-of-it’s-kind bi-directional integration between SAP Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk. See a demo of how Enterprise Threat Detection’s open, extensible framework enables an exchange of alerts with Splunk to facilitate real-time attack investigations from either platform plus the ability to rapidly take action within the SAP landscape or broader heterogenous infrastructure.SAP Enterprise Threat Detection is a powerful native SAP HANA application that quickly identifies suspicious patterns at the application server and database level. When a potential SAP software-specific threat is identified, Enterprise Threat Detection can send an alert to Splunk to correlate with other application and infrastructure data for deeper investigation or trigger immediate action. Conversely, InfoSec teams using Splunk to rapidly identify anomalies across the broader security infrastructure can send alerts to Enterprise Threat Detection for forensics or to trigger appropriate actions in the SAP environment. The combination of Enterprise Threat Detection and Splunk enables organizations to more effectively combat security issues across the enterprise spanning applications and infrastructure.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Maturing and scaling your security operations rests on your ability to process and analyze huge volumes of often unrelated data in real time. But today&#x27;s tools notoriously overwhelm SOC analysts with the sheer number of alerts and high percent of false positives, resulting in confusion about what tools to use for investigation and response. In this session, members of Splunk&#x27;s Security Research Team will discuss the next generation of Enterprise Security Content Updates that they developed, which integrate the entire Splunk for Security product suite to create a robust end-to-end defense—detection, investigation, and response. We will go over how to use these security guides, which will leverage Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Phantom, and Splunk User Behavior Analytics. We&#x27;ll also highlight the Run Story feature we built to operationalize ESCU Analytics stories and share tools and techniques customers can use to write and test their own use cases.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>DATEV provides information services to ~2.5 million payrolling, accounting, and tax clients. Given the sensitivity of the personal and financial data that our clients process, DATAEV decided to establish a SOC to secure our clients&#x27; information, and we put Splunk at the core of its operations. In this session we will discuss four key elements relevant to building a successful SOC with Splunk. We&#x27;ll first discuss how we formed our SOC and orchestrated its activities internally. We&#x27;ll then discuss how we use MITRE&#x27;s ATT&amp;CK™ framework to prioritize activities, how we spread our SOC&#x27;s security knowledge to all relevant groups at DATEV, and how we use Splunk to create real-time situational awareness for different SOC customers, for stakeholders, and for management.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Survival of the Fastest: The 1-10-60 Rule</comments>
      <description>Winston Churchill once said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.&quot; Then again, Churchill wasn’t in cybersecurity...While our successes are certainly never final, our failures can absolutely be fatal—to a company and our continued employment. What&#x27;s a good way to actually measure success and failure, though, outside of not appearing on the front page of the paper? Well, as CrowdStrike notes, you have on average one minute to detect an attack in progress, ten minutes to understand it, and sixty minutes to contain it. We will show how to use this 1-10-60 Rule as a measuring metric and leverage the data and capabilities within Splunk and its ecosystem to ensure that we win the survival of the fastest.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Tales From a Threat Team: Lessons and Strategies for Succeeding with a Risk-Based Approach</comments>
      <description>We&#x27;ve run a risk-based approach with our security alerts for over a year, and we&#x27;re excited to review our progress with you. We&#x27;ll discuss how we increased the number of behavioral indicators by 300% while reducing our alerts by 50%. We&#x27;ll also discuss how we expanded our risk approach to handle on premise and cloud environments within the same framework, which yielded a single alerting mechanism that leverages all of our data enrichment. We&#x27;ll also share the roadmap for our risk-based approach, which incorporates risk rules that utilize algorithms to identify risks not discovered by traditional detection approaches.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>What happens when the call is coming from inside the house? Data exfiltration by insiders is a dangerous threat, but one that often doesn&#x27;t get the same level of attention as the sexier external ones. We&#x27;ll start this session with a brief overview of why and how users exfiltrate information, and we&#x27;ll progress to tactics, such as effective SPL searches, for operationalizing insider threat detection. You&#x27;ll leave this session better able to catch insider threats in the in the act of exfiltration instead of days, weeks, or months later. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The SOC of the Future</comments>
      <description>This presentation will discuss how Security Operation Centers (SOCs) will need to change to meet the cybersecurity challenges of the 2020s. The speaker will draw on his experience as a founder of the first SOC-as-a-Service company that delivers managed security services using Splunk. Most industry analysts envision that the next generation of SOCs will leverage AI, Big Data, and the Cloud, but how far can automation take us and is the concept of an autonomous SOC really practical? How will the SOC of the Future address the global shortage of cyber professionals? How will the role of security analysts need to change? Will the SOC of the Future still need to be housed in dedicated physical facilities? The speaker will provide a blueprint of Proficio’s vision of the SOC of the Future using Splunk and provide a playbook for IT leaders and aspiring IT leaders on how to drive continuous improvement in productivity and measurable outcomes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Intel is transforming its approach to security by deploying a new Cyber Intelligence Platform (CIP) based on Splunk, Kafka, and other leading-edge technologies. Our new platform ingests data from hundreds of data sources and security tools, providing context-rich visibility and a common work surface, and improving the efficiency of our entire information security organization. This session will address how we partnered with Splunk architects to deploy and realize benefits from this solution in just five weeks. We will detail how our solution uses real-time data, streams processing, machine learning tools and consistent data models to decrease time to detect and respond to sophisticated threats. This session will cover everything from our platform&#x27;s business value to its solution architecture.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Obtaining data to develop defenses against threats is a constant challenge for security analysts. To that end, Splunk&#x27;s Security Research team developed the Splunk SIEMulator, a framework modeled after Chris Long&#x27;s DetectionLab that allows a defender to replay attack scenarios using AttackIQ in a simulated environment. SIEMulator’s Attack Range environments are all configured with Splunk forwarders and the apps necessary to create and store data in CIM data models. We&#x27;ll show you how to use the SIEMulator to produce shareable data that can help security analysts replicate scenarios and effectively detect, investigate, and respond to threats.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Machine Learning to Unlock the Potential of Your Security Data</comments>
      <description>Vectra customers and security researchers respond to some of the world’s most consequential threats. And they tell us that there’s a consistent set of questions they must answer when investigating any attack scenario.Yet, security data today is broken and unable to effectively answer those questions. It is either incomplete or storage and performance intensive.  Most teams don’t have the information necessary to properly answer the questions required to support their use cases; whether it be for threat hunting, investigations or supporting custom tools and models.In this session, hear about real-world use cases where security teams use machine learning engines to derive unique security attributes and how it is embedded into security workflows.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Splunk and DNS to detect that your domains are being abused for phishing</comments>
      <description>As a high-profile public-sector organization, the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration deals with criminals claiming to be representatives of the organization and contacting the public with phishing e-mails every day. By using Splunk and RFC’s like, RFC7208 – Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, we have developed a technique to identify phishing attacks that are carried out under the disguise of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. This technique is universally applicable. A precondition is access to the DNS logging. By means of this technique, insight can be obtained where the phishing e-mails are sent from and to whom the phishing e-mails are sent. In this talk we will start by explaining which standards are available to increase e-mail security and how we have build an app in Splunk, including dashboard and a wizard to create the necessary DNS records to gain insight information about the abuse of our domains.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Splunk to Catch Theft Rings</comments>
      <description>We helped our client use Splunk to disrupt theft rings plaguing its retail stores. We&#x27;ll present how we took in public wifi data, tracked MAC addresses that appeared in multiple stores, and ultimately created a system in Splunk that alerted in-store loss prevention teams when individuals likely to be involved in theft rings entered the store. We&#x27;ll go over the steps taken to operationalize our theft deterrence program so that you can adopt it in your organization or modify it to fit your needs.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Walking the Talk for Diversity and Inclusion in Cybersecurity</comments>
      <description>We believe that to best defend against global security threats, an organization needs defenders who represent the diverse world that we live in. Every business will benefit greatly by bringing more people to the table with varying skills, backgrounds, leadership and views to combat the diverse adversaries out there. Here at Splunk, we have created initiatives like the &quot;Developing Superwomen in Cybersecurity&quot; program that works to diversify and equalize the cybersecurity workforce to women and other underrepresented groups. Come hear how we are taking action by making cybersecurity accessible to all with this program and some practical advice on how you can do the same when you go back to your organization! You&#x27;ll receive tips on how to make information security inclusive to all with ways of engaging your staff at various levels and receive a blueprint for running your own gamified security experiences, allowing you to up-level staff while embracing their unique talents and backgrounds.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>You replaced IBM QRadar with Splunk Enterprise Security. Now What?</comments>
      <description>Never used Splunk before, have no Splunk admins and you’ve just bought Splunk Enterprise Security? That was us, and now we&#x27;re using Splunk in ways that we could&#x27;ve only dreamed of using IBM QRadar. In this session we’ll share our implementation story, how we worked with Splunk to accelerate our learning curve, and how we went from 0 to 3TB in 3 months with no Splunk admins. We&#x27;ll also cover how Splunk allows us to onboard data sources that we couldn&#x27;t with QRadar. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Does your small team also run a full-featured SOC that supports a global company? In this session we’ll show you how we’ve used Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise Security to bring together all the relevant security intelligence from our technology stack, transforming our security operations from ad hoc and tactical to strategic and compliance-driven. We’ll discuss key takeaways from our journey, such as the benefits of ingesting data properly from the outset so you can reap the rewards as you scale; how we leverage multiple use cases out of single data sources; and how we created easy-to-understand visualizations that convey our firm’s security posture to management.&lt;p/&gt;
