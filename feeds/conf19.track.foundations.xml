      <comments>Advances in Deep Learning with the MLTK Container for TensorFlow 2.0, PyTorch and Jupyter Notebooks</comments>
      <description>Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch let you extend Splunk&#x27;s Machine Learning Toolkit with custom algorithms that provide you with an edge for advanced AI and ML use cases in Security, IT Operations, IoT or for any advanced custom analytics. In this talk you learn about the latest evolution to streamline the usage of TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch with the MLTK Container extension. Integrated Jupyter Notebooks help data scientist to accelerate their custom model development, deployment and operationalization. The MLTK Container can leverage GPUs for parallel computing and accelerate model training for big complex datasets. This session is suitable for all python-minded data scientists and developers who want to tap into deep learning use cases with Splunk. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Agent Based Modeling for CryptoFinance in Splunk</comments>
      <description>Cryptocurrency ecosystems are highly complex, distributed, and rapidly evolving, rendering many existing financial models ineffective. By aggregating the heterogeneous data streams that are produced by distinct groups within crypto (blockchains, mining pools, exchanges, etc.), we have built a unified analytical platform called Nakamoto Terminal (NTerminal) using Splunk. By leveraging NTerminal, we are creating an adapted agent-based modeling (ABM) system; agents monitor the state of the ecosystem by consuming real time updates from the individual data sources that modulate their state and connectivity. Different heuristic models are called upon to facilitate data transformations and agent interactions. Within this ecosystem, collective agent activity reveals emergent properties and patterns of behavior. With Splunk as the centerpiece, integrated reports, dashboards, or searches allow you to better navigate the ecosystem of interest.&lt;p/&gt;

      <title>Analyzing and Visualizing Streaming Telemetry Data with Splunk [Splunk Enterprise]</title>

      <comments>Analyzing and Visualizing Streaming Telemetry Data with Splunk</comments>
      <description>Streaming telemetry is a new approach supported by major networking companies such as Cisco,  as well as service providers. It provides better real time data of routing/switching devices without the performance impact that comes with SNMP. Network operators who turn to streaming telemetry often have sophisticated goals in mind and are not simply looking to collect data and throw it onto a graph. Instead, they are looking at advanced use cases where further processing is performed on the data (e.g., analytics or machine learning) and intelligent action is triggered based on this analysis. This presentation. will discuss how to get telemetry data into Splunk to search, analyze, visualize, and create alerts including examples from an existing deployment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>It’s time to demystify Machine learning:-            Do you typically ask your friends what they will order, before you decide what you will order? Did you know that already the ancient Greeks clued out that numbers rules the universe?-             What makes machine learning so powerful considering the human brain is way smarter.... but maybe not always?-             This session will walk you through the basics of machine learning, what is it, what it is not. How to avoid pitfalls.-             After this session you will have knowledge around the concept of Machine Learning,  what the pre-built Splunk ML products are as well as IKEAs exploration of Splunk`s different ML techniques.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Auto-Monitoring of search workloads with Workload Management</comments>
      <description>How do you ensure that business-critical searches are not impacted by non-critical searches? How do you divvy up Splunk search capacity among internal teams? How do you assign appropriate resources for ingestion and search? Do you want to monitor runaway/rogue searches in real time and prevent adverse impact on the rest of your users? If you are struggling with these questions, this is the session for you! Splunk Workload Management puts you in control. It allows you to define resource pools, access to them, limit the maximum number of concurrent searches in a pool, and monitor rogue searches. Using Linux cgroups to allocate CPU and memory to different pools, Workload Management allows you to create separate pools for ingestion and search. You can create sub-pools within search to isolate incoming searches. The rules can be defined based on search type, user, roles, application etc. Even better, you can monitor for rogue searches and automatically abort or throttle them.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>&quot;Did we just lose ALL our knowledge objects? Do you know how much time and energy that was?&quot; After a destructive resync, Paychex lost two months of its knowledge object creations/modifications. We learned to be prepared if it were to ever happen again. How? It&#x27;s easier than you might think, and you don&#x27;t have to be an admin. You’ll learn how to proactively save your work (dashboards, reports, data models, MLTK experiments, ITSI glass tables, macros, views, etc.) and audit changes when they occur. You will leave the session knowing how to manage the ever-increasing amount of things you create. You&#x27;ll also have solutions that can save you time and effort from having to recreate lost/modified objects, including how to restore service faster. You also will come away with peace of mind knowing that you can take control of safeguarding and protecting your work, thereby covering your assets when a disaster happens.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Fabric Search(DFS) - Under the Hood</comments>
      <description>Data Fabric Search (DFS) is the next generation of Splunk’s search platform. DFS executes the following vision: Splunk should be able to leverage compute assets from anywhere and access and execute on data regardless of type and origin. Inspired by the above mantra DFS scales Splunk searches both in terms of volume and cardinality. In this session you will learn how DFS searches scale to trillion scale event volume or billion scale cardinality - capabilities previously impossible. DFS is not limited to local but by supporting scaled federated executions also powers remote splunk deployments. The Search Pipeline of DFS has been build grounds up based on lambda architecture which provides massive scale, high throughput and performance gains. At the end some of the performance and scale numbers which has been achieved internally will be shared.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Fabric Search: Opening doors to unprecedented levels of scale and performance</comments>
      <description>Data Fabric Search (DFS) is one of Splunk&#x27;s newest technologies built to handle the ever increasing rate of growth in data. Combining the rich functionality of Splunk with the parallel execution of Spark, DFS enables searching data at scales previously unheard of. This session will be decidedly for a technical audience as we deep-dive into DFS architecture and demonstrate the capabilities DFS offers to execute searches that scan more than one trillion events at a time. We will also share our experience as performance engineers with tips and tricks on how to tune Splunk deployments to take full advantage of this exciting new feature. Having additional capability to search at massive scale opens doors to use cases that no longer need to make the trade-off between depth of analysis and timeliness of results. Come learn more about Data Fabric Search and see real-world examples of its power put to use. The impossible is possible.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Fabric Search Use Cases: Real World Applications</comments>
      <description>See Data Fabric Search (DFS) in action! We will walk through real-world customer stories and demonstrate how DFS was used to make effective business decisions. With DFS, organizations can quickly weave together insights across the enterprise to get a deeper and more comprehensive view of customer behavior, organizational threats, or business opportunities. Data Fabric Search excels in speed and scale with use cases primarily falling into two categories: 1) High performance and high cardinality searches processing large volumes of data, and 2) Queries that run operations across multiple deployments. For each customer story, we will demonstrate how DFS is able to run these queries successfully and show how they created powerful business results.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Onboarding: Where do I begin?</comments>
      <description>How do I get data into Splunk? What is a sourcetype? Does Splunk already know how to handle my data? What app do I use? What if all my data is syslog? If you are asking these questions, then this session is for you. After all, data quality is the foundation of becoming a data-driven organization. This session will walk through onboarding fundamentals. We will discuss the importance of a timestamp and what to do if your data may not have one. We will explain when to use an existing or create a new sourcetype. We will review the process of examining an app from Splunkbase and determining what sourcetype the app expects. By the end of this session you will no longer use syslog as a sourcetype, but as a means of collecting data.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Stream Processor: How to get the most out of your data!​</comments>
      <description>Have you ever been asked to create a resilient petabyte scale data collection and distribution architecture? Do you need to transform data before it is indexed to remove unnecessary or sensitive data or even enrich the data with a lookup before writing the data to your index? Do you need to detect specific patterns to identify the event line break, event timestamp, or assign the appropriate sourcetype? Do you need to control where to send the data including the specific Splunk Index(es) or even a non-Splunk Sink?If so, we will show you how Splunk’s Data Stream Processor (DSP) can be used to address these requirements to meet both current and future demands. We will walk through the scenarios that customers are dealing with today for these requirements. Finally we will talk about how Universal Forwarder, Heavy Weight Forwarder, and HTTP Event Collector fit into this new data ingestion architecture.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Wouldn’t it be a great if we had Splunk’s version of Moneyball; an application where everyone comes out ahead by leveraging data to drive effective Splunk enablement and adoption? Splunk’s internal logs have a wealth of information about how Splunk is being used within your organization. Let’s take drinking the “Splunk Champagne” to the next level by applying statistics and machine learning to Splunk’s internal logs! This session will cover segmenting users based on their search profiles - number of searches run, average response times, and recency of searches executed, among other criteria. We’ll use techniques such as clustering to classify users from novice to experts, and use TF-IDF and text analytics techniques to understand commands used in search strings. Enriching this data with completed and planned Splunk Education courses, lunch &amp; learn sessions, and other training activities will enable your users to achieve the Splunk Ninja status they’re looking for! &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Driving Adoption of Splunk in Your Enterprise</comments>
      <description>So, you have Splunk in your enterprise but people aren&#x27;t using it. What do you do? After working with many organizations in financial services, we have heard the response &quot;yes, we use Splunk.&quot; However, there is a large gap between the organizations that have a Splunk license and those that are truly using Splunk. What is the key to successful adoption of Splunk as an enterprise tool? In this session hear how FIS has driven an uptake\in Splunk adoption across multiple business lines and external clients. Using Splunk, FIS have supported off-prescription solutions including system parameter inquiry, operator fraud, financial invoicing, client conference data analytics, staff resource allocations, and status reporting.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Empathy: The Forgotten Data Point</comments>
      <description>For those of us who work in the technology sector and adjacent disciplines, our technical skills are largely seen as our most valuable; the programming languages we know, what we’ve accomplished with those languages and so on. While our technical skills are usually our ticket in, they have little or no impact on how happy we are at work. For example, the correlation between your proficiency in Splunk and your commitment to your team is negligible. As life at work evolves, we see the rising need for an alternative data point: empathy. With the help of sentiment analysis, our talk will highlight how the presence or absence of empathy impacts our working lives. And, better yet, how we can change the course of a team, project, and our own perception by leveraging empathy in a conscious way.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Is confidence in your ability to disassociate real alerts from noise at an all-time low? Are alerts becoming ineffective because they’re excessive? Many organizations across many industries wrestle with these questions daily. Even so, the prevalence of alert noise persists. Join us to understand how T-Mobile is using Splunk Enterprise with the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit to identify and narrow the point of origin of service-impacting events across our suite of enterprise applications. Using the DensityFunction algorithm to highlight anomalous behavior, we’re able to focus an investigation on a small subset of the applications which in turn leads to faster resolution of the issues we’re confronted with. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Enhancing Diversity in Tech through Employee Resource Groups - Our BEAMs Journey</comments>
      <description>Splunk’s support and promotion of diversity and inclusion led to the establishment of their most recent Employee Resource Group (ERG) for black employees called BEAMS. Black Employees and Mentors, BEAMS, officially launched February 2019, and has provided a platform for underrepresented employees to make an impact within the Splunk community and beyond. Join members of BEAMS for this discussion about changing the narrative for Black employees in the tech industry, and learn how you can thoughtfully provoke the same within your organization. Come learn from the experiences of BEAMS and their open and bold mindset, how BEAMS navigates challenges associated with creating change, promoting equality within a large organization, and going beyond the office walls, and how they support partnerships with youth education organizations. Be prepared to leave with thoughtful anecdotes and an action item list for your organization.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Exploratory Data Analysis on Aviation Safety Data</comments>
      <description>It’s a bird, it’s a plane. Yes, it’s a plane! Let’s go for a flight into the skies of aviation data and the concepts and tools that make aviation data analytics easy. I’ve been capturing this open data for nearly two years, and I’ve been able to unravel some insights based on four projects. Two projects focus on processing Canadian/U.S. safety reports, while the other two are processing data captured and logged from a radio receiver made from a Raspberry Pi. Data Science is offering very exciting careers and providing an important competitive differentiator, which is why we’ll be reviewing several statistical processing techniques made possible by the power of the Machine Learning Toolkit. We also will cover exploratory data analysis tools built into the Search Processing Language. Before we approach for landing, we’ll show everything under the hood so that everybody can understand the things that make it fly. This is both a technical deep dive as-well-as a practical usage walkthrough.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Fast and scalable replication of knowledge bundles in Splunk Enterprise</comments>
      <description>This session will highlight a new strategy for fast and effective replication of knowledge bundles, resulting in up-to-date search results and a significant reduction in WAN bandwidth usage. Knowledge bundles include the knowledge objects that a search-head distributes to search peers so that they can process a distributed search. Replication of these bundles to search peers can be slow for large deployments and also consumes significant WAN bandwidth, especially in multi-site deployments. This new replication option in Splunk Enterprise accelerates search access to recent data and reduces WAN bandwidth consumption.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Feeding the Beast: The fine art of self-service knowledge object and search management</comments>
      <description>The joys, freedoms, and advantages of running a Splunk “data democracy” at scale are numerous and well documented. However, as with many aspects of life, where there is huge upside a dark downside often lurks. How do I mange thousands of knowledge objects, or help users make their searches faster and more efficient, or deal with a myriad of small, but still time-consuming operational challenges? For answers, come and listen to this presentation by Atlassian, the world leader in software collaboration tools. Hear how the Atlassian team not only tackled such problems head on, but also how they showed users how to manage these issues in the most effective and innovative ways. From clearing out unused dashboards, to scheduling searches and lookups, to exposing the performance of searches in a developer-friendly way, we have tips, tricks, and advice for all comers, irrespective of where you are on your Splunk journey.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Forecasting Disk Usage with Machine Learning – So easy, even a cave-person can do it!</comments>
      <description>This presentation will walk users through how to use the machine learning toolkit to accurately forecast disk usage across their entire environment, giving them the exact day, month, and year when a server will run out of disk space. No more being awakened at 3:00 am for a bridge call due to a drive running out of disk. This process also can be used by capacity planning teams to select a future date and get a clear view of capacity across the business for all servers. Using machine learning to remove tech debt in an organization does not require a data scientist. You can do it if you have the right server metrics and the MLTK installed. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Going Beyond Inclusion in the Workplace</comments>
      <description>Technology has enveloped our lives - Smart TVs at home, FortNite on your morning commute, to communication with our colleagues… even when they’re the next cubicle over. Before the Internet, people who are blind had to rely on others to read the news to them, unless they were fortunate enough to have access to a braille copy. Today, a staggering amount of information is at their fingertips, thanks to the Internet and screen readers. People with limited mobility can now work home if they choose to. One disability group still faces significant challenges. Over 70% of Deaf sign language users are under- or un-employed. Many people have implicit bias assuming that communication with Deaf and Hard of Hearing employees is difficult, costly, challenging.In this presentation, Davin and Jarlath discuss how offices can not only become accessible, but go beyond creating a culture of inclusion, awareness and equity.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Handling Expanding Data Sources &amp; Datacenter Migration While Strengthening the Nutanix Security Posture with Splunk and HCI</comments>
      <description>Nutanix implemented Splunk to improve operations and security. Attend this session to learn how we started small and grew our Splunk footprint, going from 80 GB/day to 700GB-1.8TB/day, to satisfy key IT and business needs. You will also learn how we leveraged Splunk and our own Nutanix infrastructure for a successful data center migration that involved over 2000 clients and 80+TB of data. We’ll share best practices and insights into running virtualized Splunk Enterprise on hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI). You’ll also learn about an app for Phantom, which we’ll demo, we built to provide security operations teams the ability to quickly contain a VM by stopping or suspending it, then safely starting it, plus the other workloads, like firewall, Docker (incl. Splunk Docker), ETL, etc., we run alongside Splunk on the same infrastructure stack. Whether you’re a Splunk user or own the infrastructure that supports your Splunk team, you’ll get details to help you in your job.&lt;p/&gt;

Coming from a Humanities background, I tend to look at data a little differently than most engineers and data scientists. Using Splunk I&#x27;m able to freely navigate through the data and explore different use cases. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Harnessing the Next Generation of Tech Talent</comments>
      <description>Generation Z is our largest generation ever. They are over 2 billion strong and are predicted to make up nearly 30% of the workforce by 2025. Fifty percent of them are likely to have a university degree that will carry them through 17 jobs, spanning five different careers in their lifetime. So how can we harness the energy of this huge pool of &quot;think differently,&quot; &quot;act differently&quot; resources? With an internship program. Learn how the Splunk ANZ team focused on addressing the staffing challenges many tech companies face, particularly with regard to promoting diversity and including underrepresented groups, such as female students studying STEM subjects. This session will review how they built an internship program that not only delivered huge value to the business, including Gen Z diversity, but also focused on transferring technical and soft skills to facilitate their transition into full-time employment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Want to run Splunk on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)? Have a GCP environment you aren’t monitoring in Splunk? In this joint Google &amp; Splunk session, you’ll learn how to architect, build and scale a Splunk environment on GCP according to best practices for availability, performance and cost. We’ll walk you through the setup of a real-world Splunk environment on GCP, as well as the various options available for ingesting valuable Google Cloud data in any Splunk environment. We’ll leverage streaming services from Google Cloud like Pub/Sub and Dataflow to capture in near real-time operational, audit, billing, inventory data, and more. We’ll then demonstrate how to analyze this wealth of data and get immediate insights for several use cases from IT Ops to Security.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Health Insights in One-click with New Splunk Monitoring Tools</comments>
      <description>Wouldn’t it be great if you can just be proactively told when your Splunk deployment needs your attention? Wouldn’t it be simply awesome to go to one place and know exactly what the problem is and how to resolve it? At Splunk we understand that every organization suffers the pain of throwing resources to keep the lights on for their infrastructure environment. Fortunately the new version of Splunk Monitoring helps you know when things are not performing as expected. You can now see health of deployment wide without affecting your search or indexing latency and go through guided set of checks curated from years of support experience to solve issues first hand. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Helping Women in Technology to Boost Their Careers by Getting Public Recognition for Intellectual Property that They Create</comments>
      <description>This session will illuminate the world of Intellectual Property (IP) so that women are more empowered to gain recognition. The underrepresentation of women in STEM has meant that, historically, men have had a reputational advantage, but women can gain ground. IP rights provide an avenue for increased acknowledgement, both inside and outside the company. This session will cover the issues of ownership as well as the different types of IP, and which IP may be most valuable to the company. It also will explain the role of an IP group in a company, and how women can take advantage of their efforts to see their contributions being acknowledged. It also will discuss the business pressures at play, with different company groups and products vying for limited resources. The goal of this session is to give women the information and tools they need to take advantage of opportunities, gaining the much-deserved recognition they deserve, and boosting their professional career in technology!&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Understanding the intent of a natural language search is a major component of any natural language processing system. Although there are numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex problems in natural language processing, such as understanding intent also known as natural language understanding, very few of them discuss the challenges in production. In this session we take you on a journey from development to production of natural language understanding component of Splunk Natural Language Platform. We will discuss several engineering and data science challenges, and also provide holistic approaches to overcome those challenges. Attendees of the session should walk away with a deeper understanding of different state-of-the-art techniques, such as understanding the intent of a natural language search query, that can help them build their own applications in the natural language processing domain. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>For many organizations, Splunk is considered critical infrastructure. But Splunk itself does not provide any full backup solutions. Several first and third-party options exist, each with their own positives and negatives. Join us as we talk about what options exist today, why they didn’t work for us, and what we’ve built to solve this problem - right from Splunk - using the open source tool Duplicity. Users of all OS’s welcome, but the app is currently only supported for Linux.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Is managing your growing list of indexes like herding cattle? Is your Master Node struggling against a stampede of buckets? Are you ducking bullets to satisfy data access requirements at the expense of usability or search performance? This session will demonstrate the advanced, role-based data access approach being used by several large Splunk customers. You will learn alternative methods to satisfy complex data access requirements without having to allocate hundreds or thousands of indexes. This method will allow you to focus on usability and search performance as your primary criteria for designing and managing your indexing strategy.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>In Transition: Helping Veterans Navigate the Transition to Technology Careers</comments>
      <description>More than 200,000 military service members return to civilian life each year in the United States alone, with many thousands more around the globe. Many are looking to build on their experiences, leveraging the technical training and skills acquired while working in the service to their country. Thousands more are looking to change direction. Both paths can lead to the Splunk community, where we have provided access to free training for thousands of veterans through our customers, partners, and more. Join us for a discussion with some of our leading partners, including the Wounded Warrior Project, WithYouWithMe Academy, and Npower, about how veterans can navigate the transition to technology careers with help from a growing network of partners, and how Splunk can provide new and exciting career opportunities.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Life in the 3%: A Conversation on Claiming Your Space In the Workplace</comments>
      <description>“There’s always a tension between one’s individual self—one’s million data points—and the statistical breakdown of your existence. It’s the awareness of this tension that I navigate each day.” I wrote this in response to the reveal that black employee representation across Splunk’s U.S. offices was only 3%. #RepresentationMatters and having a “seat at the table” are critical frameworks and tactics to improve diversity, and this panel discussion brings together a diverse cross-section of Splunkers to further explore these topics. Specifically, panel participants will use there statistical data points (e.g., 3%) as a foil to reflect on how they’ve leveraged their individual motivations to push for and create change within their particular role. We intend for the audience to leave stirred by the ideas this conversation will open up, and moved to ask themselves what they can do to create change or elevate others who’ve been underrepresented in their workplace.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Lost In Translation - The Challenge of Managing Microservices</comments>
      <description>Instana CEO Mirko Novakovic explores microservices applications and the performance management challenges created by their complexity. Unique microservice architectures, operational and deployment needs create a large management gap. With so many moving pieces in addition to highly complex architectures, having the raw data won’t meet the challenge. There’s just too many pieces, too many dependencies and too much data for humans (even teams) to understand. New management tools are needed that translate data into information. Otherwise, each stakeholder must fend for themselves even though the ephemeral application architecture makes it impossible to find bottlenecks. It’s like trying to get directions in a foreign city where nobody speaks your language - every question and answer gets lost in translation. Mirko examines distributed microservice applications, how their complexity creates management problems, and what APM tools should do to automatically meet those challenges and deliver high performing applications.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Maximizing permissioned blockchain throughput using Samsung SDS Accelerator and Splunk MLTK</comments>
      <description>Blockchain scalability is one of the main barriers to adoption of this revolutionary new technology. Finance, supply chain, and e-commerce blockchain deployments often have peak throughputs that far exceed their baseline. For example, when tickets for a popular concert go on sale, the peak transaction throughput will result in unacceptable latency for the users. Samsung SDS Accelerator is a layer 2 scaling solution for Hyperledger Fabric that enables up to 10x transaction throughput during this burst of activity. Using Splunk MLTK, we’re able to detect and react to these bursts of activity without compromising the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk’s metric index has changed a lot since we launched it back in Splunk Enterprise 7.0. In this latest iteration, we have upgraded our data model and metric index to natively ingest and store multiple metrics in a single event to further reduce its storage footprint and lower total cost of ownership. This session with provide a deep-dive into our latest metric index layout, its evolution since introduction in Splunk Enterprise 7.0, and how it varies from a log index storage layout.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Curious about how to efficiently onboard and analyze metric data in Splunk? This talk will teach you the basic design and best practices for Splunk&#x27;s Metric Indexes. Since they were introduced two years ago, Splunk&#x27;s metric capabilities have quickly evolved. Now there is support for rollups, richer logs-to-metrics conversion capabilities, and a more efficient data representation formats. We also will discuss planned future enhancements and how you may best prepare for them today.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Why is the queue for the women’s restroom always longer than the men’s at a concert or theater? Data is fundamental to the modern world. From business decisions to economic development and public policy, we rely on data to allocate resources and make critical decisions. However, because so much of the data fails to take into account bias, such as gender and race, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. This results in missed economic opportunities and tremendous costs in time, in money and, in some cases, lives. In this session we will explore examples of data bias based on studies that are eye-opening, informative, and will change the way you look at the world. We will look at the pitfalls that lead to poor data-driven decisions, and their outcomes. We also will explore the steps you can take to inform your own data driven decisions. And, yes, we will answer the question, “Why is the women’s queue is longer than the men’s?”&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Panel Discussion | Perspectives and Practical Skills for Men as Advocates for Gender Equity</comments>
      <description>Do you want to be an ally but don&#x27;t know where or how to start? Diversity and inclusion in technology workplaces is not a women’s issue, or an issue relevant only to other underrepresented groups. Diversity and inclusion are business issues, and they are human issues. We know that businesses profit from the many benefits that diverse perspectives bring to innovation and company competitiveness. In this panel discussion, we aim to facilitate a conversation to better understand the barriers to advocacy, to promote best-practices for effective advocacy, and to enable sharing of first-hand experiences of successful advocacy.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Public Data Exploration With Splunk</comments>
      <description>Splunk is known as an excellent platform for exploring machine-generated data. We&#x27;ll explore how the platform can be used on open datasets to search for insight on real world issues such as election participation, public health, and other topics. Takeaways will include considerations for data acquisition and ingest, domain expertise, and successes and challenges from the perspective of a civic-minded individual. Lets see how far Splunk can take us!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Putting the Seamless into SSO</comments>
      <description>Ever wanted to create a seamless sign-on experience for your Splunk users, irrespective of when, where, who, or how many? If so come and listen to how Atlassian, the world leader in software collaboration tools, did just that. Atlassian’s in-house Splunk Enterprise cluster runs on Amazon Web Services and we wanted to take advantage of the latest and greatest authentication features released for the Application Load Balancer to provide that much-sought-after, seamless SSO experience for all our Splunk users. Join us as we share the technical wrangling required to make this magic happen and expand on how we leveraged the Splunk scripted authentication mechanism to introduce support for JSON web toke- based authentication. The cherry on top will be the chance to discover some of the unexpected things we learned along the way, because no tale is complete without a war story and everyone loves a great war story!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Retaining Talent and Striking a Work-Life Balance via Job-Sharing</comments>
      <description>Who says you can’t have it all? In today’s workplace, where the competition for talent is fierce, offering a true work/life balance is the key to keeping the best and the brightest as part of your organization. Based on more than 15 years of experiences across Fortune 500 companies and startups in the technology industry, Pam Sotnick and Katy Mann have been trailblazers in job-sharing and have shown how it works; not just for employees but also for organizations. Striking the right balance helps to retain talented women or men who need to reduce the number of hours devoted to their work life due to family responsibilities or other considerations. Job-sharing also can help to retain skilled workers who might otherwise choose to retire early or move to another organization. Come learn how job-sharing can work for your organization or how to make it work for you as an individual.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Running Splunk in an Air-gapped environment </comments>
      <description>Many government agencies and for-profit companies require that you run Splunk on a network disconnected from the outside Internet. This presents many challenges, including how to cross air gaps and one-way transfers, how to operate indexers in an air-gapped environment, and how to automate backwards. This session will cover lessons learned from a variety of air-gapped deployments.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Saving the Nation’s Food Supply with Data-Driven Analytics</comments>
      <description>Copper River ES, a strategic partner for Splunk public sector, is working with a large federal agency that has restructured their NOC and SOC organizations into a single unified entity as part of operational optimization.  The agency is responsible for protecting IP and other assets totaling $4.3 trillion as part of safeguarding the nation’s food supply chain.   The goal was to enhance the ability to handle problem escalations quickly and improve communications between teams. They are currently ingesting more than 3TB daily across 65 data sources where Splunk is leveraged as an integrated data platform and framework service to act as a nerve center for the combined NOC and SOC teams. Implementation has resulted in dramatically reducing MTTD to an average of less than 30 min compared to previous times of up to 12 hours, MTTR times from 16 hours to often less than 1 with overall outage times having now been reduced by about 68%. From a security perspective, it is used to identify data exfiltration and insider threats, as well as for security operations and compliance.  Increasing visibility into all aspects of system operations and troubleshooting efforts is now supported through a series of custom Splunk App’s, glass tables, reports and alerts with operational guides and training to best leverage the capabilities Splunk has generated.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Saving Thousands of Hours Per Month at Paychex with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Splunk</comments>
      <description>Robotic Process Automation (RPA) allowed Paychex to quickly eliminate over 18,000 hours of manual effort annually with only the first workflow, which was developed from start to finish in one month. Does your company have manual processes that could easily be automated through RPA efforts? If so, you could be saving thousands of hours and upwards of millions of dollars. In this session, we will show you how you can use RPA to deliver ROI and business value to your business units and executive-level management, and how Splunk can help monitor robot and workflow health and errors in real-time to developers.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know. With vast amounts of cloud data coming in at cloud-speed, it can be difficult to see through the noise and know what to look for. Are malicious adversaries attempting to comprise the environment? Is my environment under- or over-provisioned? Do I have an insider possibly exfiltrating company data? Are employees actually using the services? What is all of this costing per service, department, business unit? Don&#x27;t worry, we will help you figure all this out in a prescriptive manner by showcasing these and other use cases. Then, we will show you the &quot;how&quot; by exposing the searches, the data needed, and showing you how to onboard that data. You will walk away with use cases that can be implemented immediately in your own environment.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Splunking Crime Part II - Analysing Bias in Police Actions</comments>
      <description>Last year at .conf18 we used Splunk and Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to analyze and predict the crime in London. This year we are taking a step forward and analyzing the bias in the police actions in the U.K. We will use police, population, religion, and race data to understand how police use their powers in different areas on people from different racial backgrounds. We will use open data sources and index them in Splunk. Using advanced visualizations we will analyze the data and understand more about police actions. Then using MLTK we will create a predictive model for crimes and then analyze the model for any bias due to the data provided. Machine bias is a real issue nowadays when machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used by government agencies to predict crime and even pass sentences on convicts. We need to understand that along with having positive impact of predicting crime, it can have a long-lasting negative impact as well.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you want to rely on manual intervention to fix your application if something goes wrong? In this deep-dive session you will learn how Priceline uses machine learning to find outliers and anomalies in various data sets, including but not limited to bookings, search patterns, changes in logging patterns, etc. You will learn how we used machine learning combined with predictive analytics to solve variety of use cases. For example, we collect Kafka offset data, which is sending data to their respective syncs. We also monitor to see if the traffic is receded or data consumption has increased or decreased unexpectedly. We will show how different stages of application states are controlled with the use of data and alerts, like disabling the app and enabling it according to the data. We also will show you how Priceline deals with brownouts, the gradual degradation of volumes by using machine learning over long periods, using different self healing techniques and custom apps. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk Enterprise is powerful. Don&#x27;t cheat yourself of its power. When making decisions as to how to expand or standup Splunk’s footprint, you need to know what matters when making platform decisions. Considering compute, storage, virtualization, cloud infrastructure is a lot. There isn’t one place to review all the options you have. We will share the Splunk way to think of performance and how it relates to the underlying system resources. This means getting into the real nuts and bolts of performance. If you want to know how search affects indexing and what resources get consumed, this is the session to attend. If you also want to know how it affects what you purchase as a platform choice, this also is the session to attend. We also will review how partners have built architectures to simplify this process.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Data Fabric Search (DFS) is a paradigm shift from native Splunk and introduces several new innovative concepts such as core scaling and federated search. This sparks questions regarding: How to maximize search performance using DFS conf parameters? How to size the DFS Spark cluster? and What search time speed ups can I expect with DFS? This discourse aims to answer these questions and presents DFS best practices in the context of improving and discovering business use cases. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Take Control of Port 514!: Taming the Syslog Beast</comments>
      <description>Are you frustrated with the task of configuring syslog servers yourself to properly ingest data into Splunk? Take control of the syslog beast once and for all and point your &quot;514&quot; traffic to the new Splunk Connect for Syslog! This new Splunk-supported connector makes quick work of past struggles with syslog servers, sourcetyping, data enrichment, and scale. In this session we will dive into the configuration of the Splunk Connect for Syslog to properly filter, sourcetype, and format your data. We will demonstrate several out-of-the-box examples, highlighting new functionality such as HEC and Kafka transport for resiliency and scale, simple extensions for new device types, and data enrichment that extends far beyond simple sourcetyping of the raw message. Lastly, we will look forward to the integration of syslog with Splunk&#x27;s new Data Stream Processor, and highlight appropriate use cases for each solution. By the time we wrap up, you will know how to tame the syslog beast!&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The Cloud Gateway: A Security Deep-Dive and the Future Ahead</comments>
      <description>The Cloud Gateway is at the heart of many of Splunk’s most exciting products: Mobile, AR, NLP. It facilitates the communication from your iOS, Android, and AppleTV devices with an on-premise Splunk instance without having to set up a VPN or manage firewall rules. The connection is encrypted end to end, so even if Cloud Gateway was compromised your data would still be secure. In this session we’re going to share how Cloud Gateway provides these guarantees by doing a deep dive into the encryption used, the device authentication process, and the flow of a message from a mobile device to a Splunk instance and back again. Finally, we’re going to be talking about some exciting features rolling out to Cloud Gateway in the coming year.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>The path to operational enlightenment. An introduction to wire data with Splunk Stream.</comments>
      <description>Have you ever wondered what Joe meant when he referred to “Wire Data”? Today, you&#x27;ll see the applicability of wire data in your organization, and you&#x27;ll be amazed. Solve fraud, cybersecurity, ops, and business challenges, all with one single source of data. Wire data is the information that passes over computer and telecommunications networks to define communications between client and server devices. It is the result of decoding wire and transport protocols containing the bi-directional data payload. We will cover the use of wire data to solve security, IT operations, and business use cases, and see how the Splunk Stream platform is easily integrated into your existing data flows. The Splunk Essentials for Wire Data app from Splunkbase will be used to showcase dozens of examples using wire data to solve common business and technical issues. We will cover how to deploy and configure Splunk Stream in a distributed environment, including a demonstration.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Paychex’s goal of providing the best user experience for our clients has led to a significant investment in performance testing and monitoring of our applications. Currently all Paychex applications record the execution time for every task and subtask to logs. These are indexed by Splunk, allowing us to identifying areas where changes to code and database queries will have a positive impact on the overall user experience. This presentation will focus on combining this user experience data with client demographic data (such as the number of active employees) and using the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit to build predictive models of user experience based on client demographic data. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Using Splunk Data Stream Processor as a Streaming Engine for Apache Kafka</comments>
      <description>Do you use Kafka but find yourself limited by what Kafka allows you to do with your data? Would you like to enrich, aggregate, and alert on your data as it moves through Kafka, but can’t figure out how? You can overcome these obstacles by integrating Kafka with the Splunk Data Stream Processor. The Splunk DSP is a data streaming platform that helps you transform and enrich your data. With DSP you can make data-driven decisions in real time as data is ingested. DSP also provides simple ways to build data pipelines, and gives you full control and visibility into your data as it flows through the platform. Apache Kafka is now widely adopted as a foundational element for data pipelines. DSP integrates seamlessly with Kafka clusters, and allows data to be read from Kafka, processed in highly scalable ways, and then written back to Kafka. Join us and see how to use DSP as a streaming engine for Kafka clusters.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>What&#x27;s on your bucket list? Scalability and high volume performance of indexer clustering at Splunk.</comments>
      <description>As customers add more and more data to Splunk, indexer clusters with large volumes of indexers, indexes, and buckets are becoming commonplace. In Splunk labs we run intensive tests to explore the boundaries of the largest indexer clusters. This session will discuss the lifecycle of a Splunk bucket, why it is a key metric in indexer scalability, and which indicators and tunables to monitor in a very large cluster. We&#x27;ll also share how we do performance testing, the latest performance results, and best practices for scaling your Splunk Enterprise cluster to 20 million unique buckets and beyond.&lt;p/&gt;
