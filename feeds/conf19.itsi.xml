      <comments>Cover Your Assets: Protect Your Knowledge Objects from Yourself (and Others) - A Paychex story</comments>
      <description>&quot;Did we just lose ALL our knowledge objects? Do you know how much time and energy that was?&quot; After a destructive resync, Paychex lost two months of its knowledge object creations/modifications. We learned to be prepared if it were to ever happen again. How? It&#x27;s easier than you might think, and you don&#x27;t have to be an admin. You’ll learn how to proactively save your work (dashboards, reports, data models, MLTK experiments, ITSI glass tables, macros, views, etc.) and audit changes when they occur. You will leave the session knowing how to manage the ever-increasing amount of things you create. You&#x27;ll also have solutions that can save you time and effort from having to recreate lost/modified objects, including how to restore service faster. You also will come away with peace of mind knowing that you can take control of safeguarding and protecting your work, thereby covering your assets when a disaster happens.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Data Models: Bridging the Knowledge Gap to Work with Complex Data … Even Mainframe Data! </comments>
      <description>Do you have complex or obscure data?  Do users, without the necessary domain knowledge, struggle to work with this data?  Perhaps a Data Model can help bridge the knowledge gap.  This session will use valuable (but complex…and even scary) mainframe metrics as a working example of how to get users up and running fast by leveraging the power of a data model.  But, these principles are not just for mainframe.  They can equally apply to other data types and scenarios.  Not all users are well-versed in complex data structures and fields, but some are…so combine Subject Matter Expert (SME) knowledge with this great Splunk facility to make everyone’s life simpler.  Deliver real results in a very short time with little overhead or burden on users.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Deep Dive: How to use Splunk to protect the environment</comments>
      <description>Can Splunk help eliminate environmental risks and save the company money at the same time? The Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) sets standards defining the amount of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that can be safely released. Honda Manufacturing of Alabama (HMA) must adhere to those standards and track our compliance within the parameters set forth by the ADEM. Failure to comply with these standards will result in potentially damaging the environment and large fines. HMA uses a Regenerative Thermal Oven (RTO) to burn off pollutants from our paint department, which is controlled by an Allen Bradley Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Using this PLC and the sensors built into the RTO, we collect individual chamber temperatures, fan speeds, exhaust temperatures, motor winding temperatures, motor vibrations, and fan vibrations. Using these readings and the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit we try to predict if the temperature will be within the set range. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Have you ever been positive you had found evil, only to realize it was normal after hours of triage and work? We have all heard and love “KNOW NORMAL FIND EVIL,” but how hard is it to actually know normal? The MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework gives defenders a better map to “find evil,” but how can this framework be used to “know normal”?Rick will discuss how knowing normal in a world of abnormal is harder than one thinks, and how addressing the actual root cause of evil can improve the technology industry as a whole.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Distributed Tracing in Splunk: Get end-to-end visibility into application performance with Splunk and OpenTracing </comments>
      <description>Are you addressing the challenges of gaining visibility into a distributed microservices environment? Is your organization considering using distributed tracing to augment your APM capabilities? Have you heard of OpenTracing and want to learn what capabilities it gives you and how to get started? Come learn about the OpenTracing project and how you can use it with Splunk to get a complete picture of your application environment using logs, metrics, and traces. We&#x27;ll go from the basics of what the project is to how to get started integrating with Splunk. We&#x27;ll also review an example of a large telco customer to see how they got started with OpenTracing and how they rolled it out in their application environments.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk/VictorOps allows your data to talk to people, and your people to talk to data, all while improving MTTR/MTTI. You’re already using Splunk today to get cool dashboards, ask questions of your data with search, and trigger important alerts based on data that’s of interest to you. But, just because alerts are important doesn’t mean they are for everyone. And for those who should respond to the alert, it’s important to get the alert into their hands immediately. Transitioning to a modern NOC, or “New Operations Center,” Splunk and VictorOps enable teams to collaboratively solve issues by providing on-call users with actionable alerts that allow for smarter investigation, faster mobilization, and lower mean time to resolution. In this session we’ll take a look under the hood at different Splunk and VictorOps integrations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Do you remember the time when you had to attend lectures in person? Monash University has extended teaching hours and stopped repeating lectures. To provide flexibility to students and release pressure on finite campus facilities, lectures are now live streamed and are guaranteed to cover 100% of the classroom content. We are using Splunk and IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) to help monitor live streaming of lectures. It is impossible to manually monitor hundreds of teaching spaces in real-time and keep track of lecture schedules, the status of AV devices, microphones, and audio signals. Come and see how we at Monash University use Splunk ITSI glass tables to rule them all! Using ITSI we get real-time insights into service health and entity-level alerting based on ITSI thresholds.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Fiserv Turns ITSI Up to 11 – with Powerful KPIs, Better Performance, &amp; Custom Alerts</comments>
      <description>ITSI provides a platform to turn your never-ending stream of app and infrastructure data into manageable KPIs that you can act on, but how do you manage the number of events ITSI detects? What if you need to extend ITSI with additional capabilities in order to merge your alerts with your support team&#x27;s response processes? We will turn ITSI up to 11 by adding the concept of &quot;platforms&quot; as a collection of related services, support reoccurring maintenance windows, and generate rich alerts that include information such as which entities are impacted and what the KPI values are. These concepts are combined so that all the problems in your platform generate a single alert with alert text rich enough that that your support teams can respond without opening ITSI, and we will do it all with just SPL.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>How 3M is Transforming SAP ERP Operations through AIOPS</comments>
      <description>Discover how 3M is using Splunk to get more value and insights from their mission-critical SAP deployment and its complex legacy environment. You can see how far we have we come and where  our vision will take us. Managing SAP is a complex and mission-critical challenge. With its proprietary and often-customized inner workings, SAP has become synonymous with complexity and has long been a difficult challenge for IT departments around the globe to manage. With even short outages carrying the potential of large impacts, it is more important than ever for large ERP customers to bring their systems management and monitoring practices into the data-driven world. In this session, learn what transformational outcomes have been and are being achieved as this 116-year-old global manufacturer partners with Splunk to embrace and overcome ERP and legacy operational data chaos.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Infrastructure and System Monitoring with Splunk and Telegraf</comments>
      <description>Telegraf is a open source tool that is used for collecting metrics from a variety of inputs, including system data (CPU, memory, disk, and network), docker, MySQL, etc. Telegraf (as of v1.8) supports a &quot;splunkmetric&quot; serializer for native ingest into Splunk&#x27;s metric store using a variety of Telegraf&#x27;s output modules, including file outputs, and HTTP with the ability to include HEC-required fields. Telegraf can be deployed as a stand-alone daemon or as a Splunk application that can be pushed out from deployers, masters, and the like. We&#x27;ll investigate the various integrations with Telegraf and Splunk including using Telegraf as the system to feed Splunk&#x27;s App for Infrastructure (in lieu of collectd), custom dashboards, as well as integrations with ITSI. With Telegraf&#x27;s multitude of inputs, outputs, and a nearly universal run-time, it&#x27;s a fantastic tool to add to your system monitoring workflows.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>IBM Z continues to be the cornerstone of the global economy powering the world&#x27;s largest banks, retailers, airlines and insurance companies.   With the adoption of hybrid multicloud a reality for today&#x27;s fast moving businesses, the mainframe is no longer isolated from the rest of the IT infrastructure and is now an integral part of your cloud strategy.   As you expose and integrate your data and applications through APIs and look to gain further insight, any lack of visibility impacts your business&#x27;s ability to deliver key services .  Learn how IBM is not only providing access to the volumes of IBM Z machine data but is also providing valuable insight into that data to both operations and  lines of business. &lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Introduction to monitoring business operations with Acceleris’ party dashboard</comments>
      <description>Why should running a business feel any different than throwing a party? To demonstrate how Splunk can be used to monitor and manage business operations, the DATA Mavericks team at Acceleris has iteratively perfected its Party Dashboard. It started out as a gimmick at the inauguration party of the company&#x27;s new headquarters, but now the Party Dashboard demonstrates how Splunk’s dashboarding helps any team get real-time visibility into any operation. Join this session to learn why they chose the relevant metrics, how they collected and fed the data to Splunk, and what meaningful insights were generated as a fun introductory example of using Splunk to get visibility into your business operations.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>“Our IT-powered business processes are too slow.” Does this sound familiar? If so, that is usually the perfect starting point to dig in and start improving them. Unfortunately, specific data that could help with that effort are not available – normally. In this session we will show you how we at Arvato Supply Chain Solutions got the data we needed and used it to improve the collaboration between IT and business. You will learn how we connected different IT systems such as SAP and conveyor line to Splunk Cloud, and how this helped us to analyze business processes with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI). And, as the icing on the cake, we give you a sneak peak of the machine learning algorithm we implemented to continuously improve our business processes.&lt;p/&gt;

      <comments>Los Angeles World Airports - Streamlining event management with IT Service Intelligence (ITSI)</comments>
      <description>Los Angeles World Airport has chosen Splunk&#x27;s ITSI as their centralized event/alert management platform. We’ve consolidated alerts/events from multiple management platforms across the enterprise, reducing help desk churn by grouping similar events, and evaluating the results against smart Key Performance Indicator (KPI) thresholds so that only actionable alerts or events are processed. In addition, we’ve broken down the legacy data siloes through the use of service definitions, glass tables, and deep-dives, providing better insight for all team members. Lastly, we’ve automated ITSI service and dependency creation via the Splunk ServiceNow bi-direction integration App. Plan top attend this session and you will learn how we’ve increased visibility (making data available for everyone); increased efficiency by reducing alert/event noise; improved resolution using ITSI Smart KPIs; and implemented auto service creation via ServiceNow &lt;p/&gt;

Lastly, we’ve automated ITSI service and dependency creation via the Splunk ServiceNow bi-direction integration App. Plan top attend this session and you will learn how we’ve increased visibility (making data available for everyone); increased efficiency by reducing alert/event noise; improved resolution using ITSI Smart KPIs; and implemented auto service creation via ServiceNow </itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Monitoring your VMWare vSphere Environment with Splunk</comments>
      <description>Siloed IT monitoring for Virtualization struggles to scale as teams use different tools to monitor the same IT environment, increasing complexity and decreasing productivity. Imagine analysts, admins and virtualization teams collaborating and troubleshooting on a single platform. No more finger pointing, no more “my tool says”, no more data disagreements. Use Splunk for centralized infrastructure monitoring of your virtualized environment. &lt;p/&gt;

      <description>A large volume of known production incidents and end-user issues are still being resolved manually. This becomes worse when it happens in unusual hours and no one is there to fix it. Every minute of downtime is detrimental to business and waking up an engineer at the middle of the night to fix simple known issues is not worthwhile. Our self-healing (Event-Driven Remediation) solution fixes simple and known incidents automatically. For complex alerts, it gets relevant diagnostics and context from the logs. This could massively improve customers&#x27; and employees&#x27; experience in any organization.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Your network is speaking to you! Listen to what your applications are saying. Monitoring the metrics already present in your wire data can provide the key to understanding and characterizing their performance. Using tools like Splunk Stream, you can collect dozens of metrics at the IP, TCP, and Application layers. This session will show you how to characterize the performance of your applications and the network, and how to tell which is the source of trouble. We&#x27;ll also explore how to perform service and asset discovery with wire data as a basis of fact, correlating it with your database &quot;of record&quot; to ensure its accuracy.&lt;p/&gt;

Monitoring the metrics already present in your wire data can provide the key to understanding and characterizing their performance. Using tools like Splunk Stream, you can collect dozens of metrics at the IP, TCP, and Application layers. This session will show you how to characterize the performance of your applications and the network, and how to tell which is the source of trouble. We&#x27;ll also explore how to perform service and asset discovery with wire data as a basis of fact, correlating it with your database &quot;of record&quot; to ensure its accuracy.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>Splunk as a Tool for DevOps Acceleration</comments>
      <description>DevOps adoption requires high performing teams. One of the biggest challenges organizations have when adopting a DevOps framework is how to get early wins, get value early in the process, and overcome plateaus in adoption. These improvements are typically achieved through the use of automation, improved responsiveness, better situational awareness, and increased sharing between teams. As you will see in this session, Splunk easily sits in the middle of all of this.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Many Fortune 500 companies use Pivotal Cloud Foundry to push its high-quality code into production faster. While this helps companies enforce enterprise logging and application development standards, the traditional monitoring tools used to monitor development environments become the bottleneck because they are not architected to handle a firehose-nozzle connection. Learn how to use the new Splunk ITSI module for PCF, along with the new version of Splunk Firehose Nozzle for PCF to gain operational insight into PCF platform and increase developer satisfaction.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Splunk Enterprise is powerful. Don&#x27;t cheat yourself of its power. When making decisions as to how to expand or standup Splunk’s footprint, you need to know what matters when making platform decisions. Considering compute, storage, virtualization, cloud infrastructure is a lot. There isn’t one place to review all the options you have. We will share the Splunk way to think of performance and how it relates to the underlying system resources. This means getting into the real nuts and bolts of performance. If you want to know how search affects indexing and what resources get consumed, this is the session to attend. If you also want to know how it affects what you purchase as a platform choice, this also is the session to attend. We also will review how partners have built architectures to simplify this process.&lt;p/&gt;

We&#x27;ll cover what&#x27;s different about this new framework in comparison to both SimpleXML and Glass Tables. We&#x27;ll also cover the support roadmap for Simple XML and Glass Tables as well as what you need to know in order to migrate. If you&#x27;re planning to attend any of the other dashboard deep dive sessions, we recommend attending this one first.</itunes:subtitle>

      <comments>The path to operational enlightenment. An introduction to wire data with Splunk Stream.</comments>
      <description>Have you ever wondered what Joe meant when he referred to “Wire Data”? Today, you&#x27;ll see the applicability of wire data in your organization, and you&#x27;ll be amazed. Solve fraud, cybersecurity, ops, and business challenges, all with one single source of data. Wire data is the information that passes over computer and telecommunications networks to define communications between client and server devices. It is the result of decoding wire and transport protocols containing the bi-directional data payload. We will cover the use of wire data to solve security, IT operations, and business use cases, and see how the Splunk Stream platform is easily integrated into your existing data flows. The Splunk Essentials for Wire Data app from Splunkbase will be used to showcase dozens of examples using wire data to solve common business and technical issues. We will cover how to deploy and configure Splunk Stream in a distributed environment, including a demonstration.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>As more technology organizations pursue agility and move towards continuous delivery, a stable and reliable IT infrastructure is the foundation that enables the transformation. However, the increasing complexity of the underlying infrastructure also brings a lot of challenges. Splunk has built a variety of solutions on top of our platform to deal with this complexity and deliver analytics and troubleshooting data to our engineering teams and decision makers. We will share a bit about our continuous integration process for triaging automated tests using Splunk, how we build IT infrastructure monitoring/analytics system based on Splunk ITSI, and how we take corresponding actions via VictorOps.&lt;p/&gt;

      <description>Too many tools, too many silos between data and collaboration, Outages take too long to Identify Root Cause and There is So Much Noise Abstract:  TIAA had a goal – to replace Legacy Monitoring with an AIOps approach.  What did that mean?  They had to find a better way to break down the silos between data and collaboration and start focusing attention on the right things with the right people.  Monitoring had become about MTTI (mean time to innocence) instead of fixing the fight issues more quickly and finding a way to move from ‘reacting’ to outages to ‘preventing’ them.  ITSI has become the ‘aggregator’ of monitoring data and will help TIAA move from the old Dinosaur Approach of being event driven to the AiOps approach of Service and Priority Driven.  Learn about the Journey, the Lessons Learned, and the Best Practices to Ensure Success.   &lt;p/&gt;
